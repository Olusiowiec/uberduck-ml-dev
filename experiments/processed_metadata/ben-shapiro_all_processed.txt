/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-6.wav|Alrighty. So yesterday I think the president actually did something quite important.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-7.wav|And I understand that the news cycle is so fast these days that everybody's attention span is about half a second long,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-8.wav|but, what the president did yesterday and talking about the miseducation of America's children at the highest level, Is really, really important.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-9.wav|It actually is a very important thing. Because, the great battle that we are in as a country is whether the country really deserves to survive based on the principles upon which it was founded.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-10.wav|There are a lot of people who believe, as I discussed in my new book, how to destroy America in three easy steps, that people that I call disintegrationists,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-11.wav|who  believe that America really does not deserve to survive based on the philosophy of the philosophy upon which she has founded.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-12.wav|That the principles of the declaration of independence, that there are inalienable rights that preexist government that are given by God, or by nature.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-13.wav|And the government is instituted to protect those rights. That those principles are bad.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-14.wav|That basic principles like freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms, freedom of religion. What these really do is they re-institute and reinculcate hierarchies of power.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-15.wav|That freedom itself is simply a way of cementing current hierarchies of power because freedom of speech really is mostly set up because freedom.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-16.wav|It's set up to benefit those who are most capable of taking advantage of the freedom,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-17.wav|namely people who are wealthy or people who have access to the press.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-18.wav|That freedom to bear, arms, mostly advantages people who have guns.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-19.wav|That freedom of religion, mostly advantages people who want to go to church.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-20.wav|And thus, if we just got rid of those freedoms and we looked for equal outcome instead, this would be a better world.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-21.wav|This is the perspective of much of what they call critical race theory. It is the perspective of the sixteen nineteen project.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-22.wav|It is the, the proscriptive, perspective of so many on the radical left these days.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-23.wav|And they have gained a lot of power. I mean, there's no question about this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-24.wav|Ibrahim X Kendi is considered a real thinker in American life today,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-25.wav|which is fairly incredible because he has openly suggested that the department of that there'd be at the federal level in the executive branch, something called the department of anti-racism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-26.wav|This is an actual suggestion.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-27.wav|That there'd be legislation creating an executive department of anti-racism at the federal level, that actually has the power to strike down and rewrite any law in the United States, federal, state, or local,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-28.wav|that does not achieve equal outcome between racial groups. Which is an insane contention.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-29.wav|That is fascism. Okay. That is overt fascism, that there is an executive body that is unanswerable to the people, whose sole job it is to ensure that all laws achieve equal outcome.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-30.wav|Not that they are based on rights. In fact, rights must be violated. Kendi is perfectly clear about this. He says the solution to injustice yesterday is injustice today.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-31.wav|And the solution to injustice today will be injustice tomorrow.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-32.wav|And what he means by that is that people's rights have to be violated to fix historic ills and that we have to recalibrate the entire system.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-33.wav|Now he's not the first person to make this contention. L B J made this contention back in the sixties when he suggested that it was not enough to simplyset a level playing field.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-34.wav|Instead we had to make sure that everybody was at the starting line in the same place.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-35.wav|What he said is, you know, there are people who have been disadvantaged by American history and there are certain people who are starting behind the eight ball.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-36.wav|We need to move them out from behind the eight ball so you can have an equal race.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-37.wav|Well, that is emotionally compelling, but extraordinarily difficult to achieve without violating the rights of individuals.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-38.wav|As it turns out, the best that we can do as human beings is to simply set a level playing field. We cannot redress all historic wrongs.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-39.wav|The historical ones that ought to be redressed are the ones where the person who has harmed another person pays the person they've harmed, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-40.wav|That would be normally how you redress wrongs.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-41.wav|But to make somebody who has never harmed anybody, pay historic redress to a person who has never been harmed by this person is actually a violation of rights, it is a wrong.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-42.wav|Well, critical race theory teaches that America was rooted in these hierarchies of power and that all of America's philosophies are designed to cement those hierarchies of power.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-43.wav|They're very clear about this. They believe that enlightenment principles, things like reason, things like individual rights,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-44.wav|that these are merely a guise for reestablishing those hierarchies, Derek bell is extremely clear about this. That's what critical race theory is and it has infused large parts of the university.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-45.wav|The philosophy of the sixteen nineteen project, which is that America was rooted in slavery, that all institutions of the United States are rooted in slavery, and racism and bigotry.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-46.wav|What that really is arguing for, is that everything that is good about America is fruit of the poisonous tree and we've got to burn it all down.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-47.wav|Burn it all down is the underlying factor that unites these ideologies.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-48.wav|And all they have to do is point to the historic ills of America and say that wasn't a bug, that was the feature.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-49.wav|That the system was designed this way. And because the system was designed this way, we have to destroy the system.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-50.wav|And again, this has become sort of in a soft way, written into the culture in a variety of ways.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-51.wav|When people talk about systemic racism, What they mean is that all the systems of the United States are inherently racist and unfixable racist, so you have to destroy the system from within.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-52.wav|This is why it's always been bizarre to watch somebody who's an establishmentarian, like Joe Biden, talk about systemic racism. Because he never offers any solutions.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-53.wav|Systemic racism is merely a formula for, if you give me power, I will fix. But of course he has no power to fix systemic racism because if it's embedded in the institutions, the only solution is to tear down the entire institution.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-54.wav|This is the case made by Isabel Wilkerson and KA in, uh, her book cast. I  mean, she, she suggested that the problem with the United States is foundational.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-55.wav|It is not a problem with structural insecurities in the walls of the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-56.wav|Instead it lies right at the foundation. The only way that you can fix that is to raze the house  completely.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-57.wav|R A Z, raze the house, right. Destroy it. And so this is the philosophy and, and it is being taught increasingly across the country.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-58.wav|It has, it has infused the teaching of American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-59.wav|Howard's Zinn obviously a very, very popular historian who's become in Vogue with the jet set glitterati out here in Hollywood which is why he's named checked about eight different times in Good Will Hunting.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-60.wav|Howard Zinn was a, an actual Marxist who suggested that every good that America had ever done was shot through with historic evil, including the victory in world war two.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-61.wav|He actually says in a people's history of the United States, that the American victory over Nazi-ism was marred by the fact that America took Nazi-ism into its bones, took fascism in.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-62.wav|I mean, he says this in his book, America took. All of the lessons of the Nazis and integrated them, right? It was in America's bones.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-63.wav|We, we, we fed off of the evil ideology of the Nazis.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-64.wav|America is always and inevitably historically wrong.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-65.wav|Now, it is true that for many decades in the United States, there was a willingness to overlook the dark spots in American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-66.wav|And that's wrong. We shouldn't overlook the dark spots in American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-67.wav|I've given entire speeches about this. When I spoke at Boston university last year, I overtly talked at length about the tremendous, horrific evil of American slavery,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-68.wav|and the tremendous horrific evil of Jim Crow. I talked about the heroism of people who fought both, the heroism of the leaders of the civil rights movement,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-69.wav|and the heroism of everyday black Americans who fought in defense of the American flag,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-70.wav|that, in many cases was still held by people who wanted to subjugate them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-71.wav|I, I, I end my book, how to destroy America in three easy steps by telling the story of a member of the red tails during world war two,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-72.wav|a black American who came back to a segregated America but fought on behalf of the constitution and the declaration of independence in the skies above Germany.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-73.wav|There's tremendous heroism in the American story and there's tremendous darkness, but the heroism outweighs the darkness and the philosophy of the United States is what has allowed us to grow.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-74.wav|It's what has allowed us to take universal evils and destroy them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-75.wav|In the United States, see the way that people who really don't like the United States think about the United States is that all universal human evils are unique to the United States and all unique American goods are universal.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-76.wav|So this is why you'll see from the left the idea that the landing on the moon, the moon landing, was not an American achievement. It was a human achievement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-77.wav|We got a lot of this last year when it was the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-78.wav|It was in a universal human achievement. It wasn't an American achievement. It was a human achievement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-79.wav|The growth and prosperity of the United States. That's not an American achievement. That's a world achievement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-80.wav|That the natural state of man is to be prosperous.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-81.wav|It's something Nelson Mandela once said idiotically the natural state of man is to live life, a life of chaos and privation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-82.wav|That is the natural state of man. It takes civilization to prevent that from happening.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-83.wav|We've developed entire civilizations to prevent all of us from living in the wild. That's what civilization was designed to do and took thousands of years of development to get here.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-84.wav|The level of ingratitude toward America, that it takes to look at the things that make America great,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-85.wav|our level of freedom, our level of prosperity, spreading that freedom and prosperity to billions of people abroad over history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-86.wav|And to say, well, you know, that was universal, but what's unique about America is American slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-87.wav|It's historically ignorant. It is wrong-headed and it is designed to disintegrate the bonds that tie us together.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-88.wav|If the, if the thing that makes America exceptional is American slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-89.wav|You know, leaving aside the fact that some twelve million slaves were, were brought from Africa to the Western hemisphere,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-90.wav|the vast majority of whom never saw American shores. Most of them actually ended up in South America and the Caribbean,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-91.wav|did to ignore the fact that slavery was he an evil human universal for nearly all of human history up until the last five minutes or so historically speaking.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-92.wav|And then to say that America was unique in this way, but that prosperity was universal and America is not unique in that way.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-93.wav|You have to be blind. Or you have to be motivated to destroy everything.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-94.wav|And that's really what is going on here. So unfortunately the sixteen nineteen project is now being taught in a lot of public schools.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-95.wav|Howard Zinn is being assigned in nearly every college classroom that I'm aware of.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-96.wav|And it's not being taught as a corrective to whitewashed history. That'd be one thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-97.wav|It'd be one thing if you read a patriotic history of the United States that sort of glossed over problems in American history,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-98.wav|and you said said, okay, and now you should also read this chapter of Howard Zinn that reminds us of all the bad stuff in American history. That's not how this stuff is taught. It just taught as a replacement for American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-99.wav|It is an instead of, not in, in addition to.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-100.wav|The sixteen nineteen project openly stated this, they said that America's true founding was sixteen nineteen.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-101.wav|Not that America's founding was in seventeen seventy six. But we have to take into account the legacy of sixteen nineteen, in looking at the history of the United States,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-102.wav|that'd be fair. Because obviously slavery has a lot to do with the history of the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-103.wav|That's not what sixteen nineteen project contended.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-104.wav|It contended that the actual founding of the United States, the values upon which the United States was founded, were the importation of African slaves to the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-105.wav|Or to the pre United States  since the U S didn't exist yet. It's the British colonies in, in Virginia.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-106.wav|That, that is, an absolute overt lie. So yesterday on constitution day, president Trump spoke overtly about this and people lost their minds, which shows the gap that has emerged in American public life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-107.wav|When I say there's a gap between people who want to disintegrate American history and people who believe in American history,|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-110.wav|They suggested that when he said that Americans should be taught to be patriotic about the greatest country in world history, which they should be,|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-112.wav|If you believe that teaching American children, that their country is exceptional and good is a sign of Nazi-ism it's because you are both historically ignorant and malevolent.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-130.wav|Okay. So yesterday president Trump gives the speech on constitution day in which he says we need to stop teaching critical race theory and sixteen nineteen project nonsense.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-131.wav|And Howard Zinn, in our, in our public schools.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-132.wav|And people just, they, they threw a bleep fit. I mean, they just went nuts over this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-133.wav|Now here is the basic rule that I have when it comes to federal education.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-134.wav|I think that the federal government should not be involved in education. I think the department of education should be abolished.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-135.wav|The reason I believe this is because the same federal department of education capable of telling the States to teach good history is similarly capable of telling the States to teach quite bad history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-136.wav|Or to teach common core. It seems to me that education should be devolved to the lowest level,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-137.wav|meaning that you should be able to control education in your local community or at the state level.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-138.wav|I mean, I, in an ideal world, obviously you would have community schools that are directly funded by parents and by members of the community,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-139.wav|whether it's parochial schools or whether it's private schools or whether it's charter schools,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-140.wav|but in any case, if the federal government is to be involved in the business of education, certainly it has a stake in people not learning false history and pseudo history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-141.wav|And history directly designed to undermine the foundations of the United States,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-142.wav|because then we lose all commonalities. So here was Trump going after critical race theory and the sixteen nineteen project.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-143.wav|Absolutely true. I mean, someone to write a book about it. Oh wait. I did.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-144.wav|How to destroy America in three easy steps, if you want the long version of Trump's speech with a full chapter on a more accurate history of the United States and what that would look like,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-145.wav|including all of the dark spots in American history, including the mistreatment of black Americans, the mistreatment of American Indians and all the rest.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-146.wav|Okay. He is correct about this. This is toxic stuff, suggesting that America has no foundational principles, which is what C R T says,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-147.wav|that all the foundational principles are basically just a pasteboard fabric that is designed to obscure deeper evil attempts to install racial and class hierarchies.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-148.wav|It's disgusting. And it destroys the country.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-149.wav|And he's exactly right about this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-150.wav|Any country that hopes to survive has to share a philosophy, has to share a history, has to share a culture.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-151.wav|C R T, sixteen nineteen project, they're aimed directly at this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-152.wav|Now it used to be by the way that, um, the, the, uh, Nicole Hannah Jones of the world would, would fully admit this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-153.wav|Right, Nicole Hannah Jones literally tweeted this out about sixteen nineteen project back in July,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-154.wav|quote, I've always said the sixteen nineteen project is not a history, it is a work of journalism that explicitly seeks to challenge the national narrative.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-155.wav|And therefore the national memory. The project has always been as much about the present as it is the past.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-156.wav|In other words, we want to shift how Americans think about America. Dramatically.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-157.wav|Right. We don't want to shade it. We don't want to remind them of bad things. We want to completely shift the narrative.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-158.wav|In the credit, I mean, she's a radical, is an incredibly negative thing. The fact that you won a Pulitzer for a project that is so bad, it was fact checked and she refused to change the facts.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-159.wav|She is just, she's awful. And the fact that they made her the de facto editor of the New York times demonstrates where our media are at and where the far left are at, or the mainstream left, I should say at this point.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-160.wav|Okay. So Trump continued, he said it is child abuse to teach critical race theory to kids.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-161.wav|This is one hundred percent true again.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-162.wav|Teaching a child of any ilk, that in a free country, you are a victim. And that you're inherently a victim because the systems will victimize you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-163.wav|The systems are out to get you. There is no greater act of viciousness you can visit upon a child than teaching a child that no matter how hard you work you are bound for failure.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-164.wav|That is a vicious thing to teach a child. I have three children.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-165.wav|Last I checked, we all live in the United States. My kids are Jewish as it turns out. And it turns out that the number one group in the United States targeted for hate crimes are Jews.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-166.wav|Do you think that I'm telling my six-year-old that no matter what you do in the United States, you will not succeed?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-167.wav|First of all, I can't tell my kids that because it's an overt lie, but beyond that, it is, it is an act of deep abiding immorality to teach people that they are victims of systems they cannot see,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-168.wav|when, especially when that is not true. It turns out that when people are, are victims of systems, you typically can see it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-169.wav|Right. Jim Crow is a system where you can point out and say, you know, you're a victim of the system because they literally will not allow you to go to that school across the street because of your race.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-170.wav|That is a fairly obvious situation in which you are a victim of the system.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-171.wav|Even in that situation, the most successful people are people who don't think of themselves as victims.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-172.wav|Victim uh, being a victim is not, is not being a hero. Overcoming victimhood is heroism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-173.wav|Reveling in the fact that there are obstacles in life, is the least likely thing to lead you to a successful life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-174.wav|And it happens to be an overt lie in modern America. So here's Trump saying that C R T is effectively child abuse.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-175.wav|This is, this is ideologically correct. Calls for patriotic patriotic education. This is what drove everybody nuts.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-176.wav|The minute you say patriotism to the left, that the fact that the word patriotism is anathema to the left should tell you something about what the left believes about the country.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-177.wav|Do you want to live in a country where the entire governing system that the people, the entire intelligentsia believe that being a Patriot makes you a bigot?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-178.wav|Because that, this is what people believe. I am not joking.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-179.wav|Online, as soon as Trump said patriotic education, people st,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-180.wav|Hitler youth trended yesterday on Twitter, because he said that he thinks that Americans should be patriotic about the country and that kids should be taught to be patriotic about the country. Hitler youth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-181.wav|That's insane. He's not saying that you should be patriotic about all of the America's evils. He's saying you should be patriotic about America's founding documents, about our ideology, about our history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-182.wav|That you should be patriotic and recognize the evils of American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-183.wav|In the speech he mentioned some of the evils of American history, but the media deliberately overlooked that in order to declare that he was some sort of Uber nationalist,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-184.wav|Deutschland, Uber, Alice, Naz, it's insane. It's insane. Yeah, we'll get to more of this in just one, one second,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-185.wav|but first with everything going on right now, you may be wondering whether you can get life insurance. I mean, there are wildfires and hurricanes and pandemics and riots. I mean, it's a good time, time out there, but you do need life insurance.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-186.wav|Can you get it? You can. All you need to do is head on over to policy genius dot com right now.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-189.wav|Policy Genius is an insurance marketplace built and backed by a team of industry experts.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-190.wav|Here's how it works. Step one, you head on over to policy genius dot com.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-192.wav|Step two, apply for your lowest price and step three, the policy genius team handles all the paperwork and the red tape.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-193.wav|They handle the rest. Policy Genius works for you not the insurance company. So if you hit speed bumps, they will handle it for you.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-196.wav|Policy genius dot com. Again,  that's policy genius dot com.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-197.wav|Okay, so Trump yesterday calls for patriotic education. This should not be controversial.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-198.wav|Of course, Americans should believe America is good. How this is in any way controversial is absolutely beyond me.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-199.wav|It's it, it, frankly, I think that, that you have to be mentally deficient to believe otherwise, that that American children should be taught that the country that they inhabit is good,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-200.wav|and that it has historically, provided incredible good for the world and that its founding ideology is good.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-201.wav|What? You want them taught that America's evil? I mean, the answer is yes, that is the actual answer.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-202.wav|There's a huge cadre of Americans who believe that children in America should be taught that the country is evil and must be torn down to the root.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-203.wav|Here's Trump yesterday. Okay, this is not a bad thing. So people went nuts over this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-204.wav|They went totally crazy. Yamish Alcindor, who's a quote unquote reporter over at N P R,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-205.wav|she's not a reporter. She's a propagandist. Paid for, with your tax dollars. Over at N P R.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-206.wav|She tweeted out, trump just announced, he will soon be signing an executive order, establishing a quote national commission to promote patriotic education called the seventeen seventy six commission.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-207.wav|It is unclear what that means, but he has been trashing the sixteen nineteen project, which aims to educate the nation with facts.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-208.wav|No, the sixteen nineteen project is a pseudo historical piece of garbage. Historians agree on this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-209.wav|There are five separate Pulitzer prize winners who went to the sixteen nineteen project founder and said, you guys are screwing up the facts and she ignored them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-210.wav|Juliet Joffey, who's an idiot. And she tweeted out, you know, who else is really into using the government to promote patriotic education in schools? I feel like I don't even need to say it anymore.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-211.wav|Her answer, Putin!! Putin!! Because Putin! Loves patriotic education. Putin!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-212.wav|Yes, I'm sure Vladimir Putin also likes to eat a hamburger from time to time and breathe human air and drink water.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-213.wav|Like, the Hitler also had a dog argument is getting pretty weak here, guys. How about you argue exactly what you want to taught in American schools?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-214.wav|Because it turns out that what a lot of these people want is not American history taught in an accurate way with all of the great and glorious founding ideology of the founders.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-215.wav|Not with the full history of the United States with all of its downs and all of its ups.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-216.wav|Instead, what they want is an unending litany of America's evils.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-217.wav|And the underlying argument being that all of those evils are a direct result of America's constitutional governmental system and the false principles of the declaration of independence.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-218.wav|This is the argument that is taking place.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-219.wav|This is exactly the argument that's taking place.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-220.wav|It was amazing. Some people I was friendly with, I was tweeting with yesterday, online people getting very angry at Trump over this saying, well, he's, Trump's patriotic education. It's just going to whitewash history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-221.wav|I said, do you think that Donald Trump is actually going to sit there and write the curriculum?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-222.wav|Like, really? Donald Trump is going to sit there and write? The same people who believe that Donald Trump has no attention span, is an idiot.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-223.wav|Think that he is simultaneously developing the vaccine so as to kill, everyone, and also he's going to write the entire educational curriculum for every young child across the country.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-224.wav|Alternatively, he will have exactly what he said he will have, a national commission that takes a look at educational standards and says,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-225.wav|we are not going to teach pseudo historical neo-Marxist garbage about how America is inherently evil.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-226.wav|That's a good thing. Again, you want to make the argument on a systemic level, the federal government should not control educationm I'm with you. Let's do it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-227.wav|I don't think you want to have that argument. I think what you actually want is to force the federal government to sponsor and subsidize your anti-American bull crap.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-228.wav|Adam Serwer, who writes for the Atlantic sometimes intelligently, sometimes not,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-229.wav|he tweeted out yesterday. It's it's political correctness to say that the federal government should stop the teaching of sixteen nineteen project or critical race theory. That's political correctness.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-230.wav|No, it's political correctness to demand that the federal government subsidize that stuff.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-231.wav|If you want to make the argument that the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing education and attaching strings, join the libertarian side gang.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-232.wav|But. If you're arguing that the federal government gets to make the rules,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-233.wav|then, of course the federal government has somewhat of a stake in ensuring that people do not learn that would be a good thing to tear out all the institutions of the federal government.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-234.wav|And by the way, they would be right. Especially when you're talking about pseudo historical nonsense.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-235.wav|Okay. In just a second, we're going to get to, what is the greatest troll move I think I may have ever seen in politics. It's pretty spectacular from the Trump administration.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-236.wav|Then we'll get to Joe Biden's, stumbling and bumbling around a drive in stage. He thought it was nineteen sixty five. It was great for him.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-237.wav|We'll get to that in just one second.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-238.wav|First, let's talk about the fact you are spending way too much money on your cell phone bill. Like a lot of too much money.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-239.wav|Why? Well, a few reasons, one you're paying for all of the middlemen, right? You go over to one of these big cell phone stores, and now you're paying for the storefronts and you're paying for all the employees and all that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-240.wav|But beyond that, you're also paying for unlimited data, which you're probably not using.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-241.wav|Instead, why don't you just go over to peer talk. Peer talk will give you the exact same coverage, same tower, same bars as a t and T, Verizon, T-Mobile.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-242.wav|But it'll cost you half, no contract, no excessive fees.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-243.wav|Right now you can enjoy unlimited talk, text and two gigs of data, all for just twenty bucks a month.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-244.wav|The average person is saving four hundred dollars a year on their wireless bill.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-245.wav|So grab your mobile phone, dial pound two fifty and say Ben Shapiro. When you do, you save two hundred and fifty bucks off any iPhone, including the new iPhone s e.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-246.wav|Again, that is pound two, five zero. Say keyword, Ben Shapiro.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-247.wav|Pure talk U S A. Simply smarter wireless. Go check them out right now. You're overpaying your cell phone bill.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-248.wav|Why exactly would you not seek to save four hundred bucks a year on your wireless bill? And again, you'll save two hundred fifty bucks off any iPhone, including the new iPhone s e,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-249.wav|when you get involved, dial pound two, five, zero, say keyword Ben Shapiro to get started with pure talk USA today.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-250.wav|Okay. So I, I will say that calling the left on their B S is extraordinarily fun to watch.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-251.wav|It, it really is. So the entire educational system of the United States, higher education particularly has decided to imbibe deeply.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-252.wav|Drink deeply, from the narcissistic disassociate of wellspring of critical race theory.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-253.wav|What I mean by that is that there are a bunch of people in higher education who want to say, yeah, America's racist, but we're not, we're not that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-254.wav|So we will acknowledge our own racism. We will provide, we will do the malice struggle sessions, where we announce our own guilt and that, and thus, we shall have alleviated our guilt and we have reestablished our moral bone of fighters.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-255.wav|And now we get to make the new rules.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-256.wav|Right. We will have expiated our white guilt and reestablished, our moral authority over everyone to restructure the system from within.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-257.wav|And this is why you see all these major corporations sending out letters. Talking about the evils of capitalism and how America's racist and they're racist.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-258.wav|Do they really believe any of that stress? Of course they don't.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-259.wav|Of course that, there's not one of these major corporations whose leadership truly believes that America is deeply and inherently systemically racist, that their company is deeply systemically racist, or that capitalism is bad.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-260.wav|Not one of these companies believes that. The N F L does not believe that, the leadership of the N B A does not believe that none of that, no one believes this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-261.wav|This is all cowtowing to a particular narrative, so people will leave them alone. It is so that they can buy the allegiance of the wokesters in the media.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-262.wav|And the woke scholes online. Twitter now runs the universe. Okay. So.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-263.wav|Princeton university decided to do this recently on September second, according to the daily wire ,Hank Berrien reporting,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-264.wav|the president of Princeton university, whose name is Christopher Eisgruber, issued a mea culpa in a letter in which he argued that Princeton still evinced racism, writing quote,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-265.wav|racism and the damage it does to people of color nevertheless persist at Princeton as in our society. Racist assumptions from the past also remain embedded in structures of the university itself.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-266.wav|Right. This is the systemic racism argument. I've talked about it a million times at this point.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-267.wav|The argument on systemic racism is not the same as the argument that racism still exists.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-268.wav|Of course racism still exists. Of course, there are still racists. People do racist things. That is a condition that is inherent to being a human being. It just is.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-269.wav|Racism exists in all societies, and all places, at all times. If you want to see truly racist societies against black people, you might want to take a look at some of the countries over in Europe or in Asia.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-270.wav|Seriously. They've done polling, data on people across the world and how comfortable they would be living with somebody who's not of their race next door.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-271.wav|And the United States ranks super high on the list of people who are comfortable living with somebody of a different race next door.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-272.wav|That's true also for Canada and the U K. It is very low other places.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-273.wav|Okay. In any case. The argument is not about racism. It's about structures of racism, structural racism, a term, institutional racism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-274.wav|First coined by Stokely Carmichael, who later became a criminal. Stokely Carmichael.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-275.wav|Uh made the argument that because history matters, all of racism is embedded in structures.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-276.wav|And the way that you can tell if a structure is racist, is if the, is if the result of the structure has racial differentiation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-277.wav|So it's just early stage Ibrahim X Kendi.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-278.wav|And the only way to get rid of that racism is therefore to tear down the structures.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-279.wav|So this is what Princeton means when they say that racist assumptions from the past remain embedded in structures of the university itself.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-280.wav|And so they issued this letter, right? Christopher Izegruber, to the entire Princeton community.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-281.wav|This is the gr, you ready for this? This is the greatest troll of all time.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-282.wav|Honestly, Betsy Devoss deserves a medal as secretary of education for this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-283.wav|She deserves like the full on the full-on weird face meme from Twitter, like engraved in gold.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-284.wav|See here's, here's what she did on Wednesday. The department of education fired off a letter to Princeton declaring that the university would now be federally investigated stating it was quote, concerned.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-285.wav|Princeton's non-discrimination and equal opportunity assurances and its program participation agreements from at least twenty thirteen to the present may have been false.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-286.wav|The letter, obtained and published by the Washington examiner continued, based on the facts, the secretary of education may consider measures against Princeton for false program participation agreement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-287.wav|Non-discrimination assurances, including an action to recover funds.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-288.wav|Also, she may considered measures against Princeton for making substantial misrepresentations about the nature of its educational program, including a fine proceeding.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-289.wav|The serious, even shocking nature of Princeton's admissions compelled the department to move with all appropriate speed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-290.wav|The examiner noted that an admission from Eizgruber about the systemic racism of Princeton raises concerns princeton has brn, been receiving tens of millions of dollars in federal funds in violation of title six of the civil rights act of sixty four,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-291.wav|which declares no person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-292.wav|or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-293.wav|So basically what happened here is the department of education is now taking Princeton at its word. Okay. You guys say you're systemically racist? Good. We're investigating you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-294.wav|You say that all of your institutions are shot through with racism. Well, you know, that's illegal in the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-295.wav|You receive federal dollars. So we're going to look at you and maybe we'll just take back our tens of millions.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-296.wav|So now Princeton is going to be forced to argue privately to the federal government that they're not racist, but publicly that they are racist.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-297.wav|Or that if they are racist, it's not manifesting in actual mistreatment of black people, it's just kind of out there.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-298.wav|Good. Call the bluff! Seriously call the bluff. I love it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-299.wav|If you are going to go out there as a, as a, a, an entity receiving public dollars and claim that you are the result of a racist system and that your systems themselves are racist,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-300.wav|that's illegal in the United States, it's been illegal for fifty years in the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-301.wav|So, all right, let's do this thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-302.wav|Slow clap for Betsy Devoss, man. Slow clap department of education. Whoo!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-303.wav|This is, this is the, the only reason I have ever seen for the department of education, not to be abolished. That is that this is the only reason in history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-304.wav|So good, good. Honestly, this is, by the way, this should be your tactic in everyday conversations.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-305.wav|When someone says America's systemically racist, you should say to them, are you a racist?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-306.wav|Because they will usually say yes. And you say, well, I don't talk to racists.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-307.wav|And if they say no, then you say, well, if you're not racist, why are you imputing racism to everybody else?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-308.wav|What have I done? That's racist. What have you done that's racist? I|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-309.wav|f they say, well, we are all racist, then you say, okay, well, how do you, expiate your racism?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-310.wav|And they say, well, you admit it. Say yes, but now you've admitted you're a racist. So I, so why would I, why would I allow you to expiate your racism simply by admitting that you're a racist.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-311.wav|You've literally said that racism is unalterable. It is a facet of being white in America.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-312.wav|So you can't expiate your own racism. And it doesn't matter how many times you mimic the slogans of B L M and how many stupid lawn signs you put on your lawn.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-313.wav|It's inherent in your whiteness. You can do a maoist struggle session, but the, the demands never end.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-314.wav|So I'm not going to take you seriously. You shouldn't take anybody seriously who makes these sorts of contentions.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-315.wav|Or if you do take them seriously, then go ahead and take them literally and ask them to prove their own racism. Should be a fun conversation?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-316.wav|And meanwhile, Joe Biden got the softball treatment from C N N, who could have predicted. Who could have predicted.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-317.wav|We'll get that in just one second. First, let's talk about sleep quality. So, last night, I go to bed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-318.wav|It was like ten forty five. Feed my baby. I get in bed and I am out like a light. Why am I out like a light?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-319.wav|Because I'm on boland branch sheets, boland branch sheets, they're the softest most comfortable, pure organic cotton sheets on earth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-320.wav|Boland branch cotton, it's rain fed. Pesticide free. It carries the highest organic certification.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-321.wav|That is why it is indeed so soft. Because they work with family owned mills all over the world to expertly weave every set of boland branch sheets with the highest levels of craftsmanship.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-322.wav|It is quality you can feel the moment you open the box. Honestly, like I had a bunch of old sheets.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-323.wav|I threw out all of them after I tried boland branch. It ruined bad sheets for me.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-324.wav|Since they sell direct to you, boland brand sheets start at just one hundred and sixty bucks.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-325.wav|These are a thousand dollars quality sheets for a fraction of the price. Plus, you can sleep on them for a month. Risk-free.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-326.wav|And right now you get fifty bucks off any sheet set at boll and branch dot com with promo code Ben Shapiro, spelled B O L L and branch dot com com. Promo code Ben Shapiro.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-327.wav|For 50 bucks off boll and branch dot com. Promo code Ben Shapiro. There's a reason that millions of Americans and three former u s presidents sleep on boll and branch sheets.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-328.wav|Restrictions may apply. See boll and branch dot com for details.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-329.wav|Is good stuff. B O L L and branch dot com. Promo code Ben Shapiro for fifty bucks off.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-330.wav|These are fantastic, fantastic sheets.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-331.wav|Okay, in just a second, we're going to get to Joe Biden's Sterling performance in which he did not physically fall over, but also did not really say a lot of sentences that made sense.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-332.wav|We'll get to that in just one second. First is that glorious time of the week. When I give a shout out to a daily wire member.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-333.wav|Today, it is amateur M M A fighter bang, bang, Sandy Chang on Instagram who understands the need for proper hydration.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-334.wav|After a grueling workout. In the pic, Sandy is donning her purple belt and gi while proudly clutching the world's finest and most elite beverage at vessel.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-335.wav|The caption reads I'm always so thirsty after seven a m jujitsu. Hashtag good morning, hashtag leftist tears, tumbler, hashtag Merica.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-336.wav|Well done. My friend. Thanks for the pic. Continued success in the octagon.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-337.wav|And yes, there is no question that this person can absolutely kick my ass.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-338.wav|By the way, if you're watching on YouTube on September twenty eight, all of my shows contents will be moving to my channel. youtube dot com slash ben Shapiro.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-341.wav|So I'm telling you if you don't want to miss it, you need to like pause what you're doing right now. It takes five seconds.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-342.wav|Search Ben Shapiro on YouTube, go to the channel, hit the little bell. You're subscribed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-343.wav|We're making room for some new exclusive content over on daily wire, but, I'm also making a lot of new content you can only find on the channel belonging to me!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-344.wav|So subscribe to youtube dot com slash ben Shapiro. Ring the bell. Make sure you never miss out on a new video.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-345.wav|Also, I recently sat down with Matt Yglesias of vox dot com for the Sunday special.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-346.wav|This is a great Sunday special. It was really fun. We discussed a bunch of stuff ranging from cancel culture to how you can have cross aisle political discussions.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-347.wav|One of the things that was really fun about this is Matt and I been sniping at each other on Twitter for years and years and years.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-348.wav|And we still had a friendly conversation because it turns out that people can still have friendly conversations.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-349.wav|All they have to do is not be jackasses. Give it a listen this Sunday.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-350.wav|If you can't wait until then, go subscribe at dailywire dot com slash subscribe. And you can watch the episode a day early, take a bit of a listen to the trailer.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-351.wav|Again, I think that the, the gap in the United States right now is not even really between everybody who is kind of left leaning and everybody who's right-leaning,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-352.wav|I think it's between liberals and conservatives on the one hand and wild leftists who wants to destroy the country on the other, then that is their fundamental ideology.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-353.wav|Okay. Well, you are listening to the largest, fastest growing conservative podcast and radio show in the nation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-354.wav|Alrighty. So Joe Biden had a town hall last night. So I remember a couple of nights ago.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-355.wav|Donald Trump had a town hall on A B C and it basically amounted to George Stephanopoulos asking him why he's a bad orange mean man.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-356.wav|And then a bunch of members of the audience were undecided in that they were undecided whether to vote for Bernie Sanders as a write-in or undecided whether to vote for Joe Biden.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-357.wav|That was really like the entire audience, like look at these undecided voters who have to decide whether or not to cast a vote for the Marxist party or for the neo-Marxist party. It was amazing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-358.wav|So Joe Biden does a town hall on C N N and he has not asked a single really difficult question during the entire time.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-359.wav|He still manages to sort of bloviate his way through it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-360.wav|Now understand that Joe Biden's entire campaign is I'm a nice old ca, codger.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-361.wav|I mean, that's really what I am, I'm just a. I'm a nice old man and I have caring and empathy and he sort of falls over, but he hasn't fallen over and that's really the key to his campaign.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-362.wav|And the minute he falls over, he's got a real problem on his hands.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-363.wav|And I mean, let's face it. We've had two presidential candidates in the last thirty years who have literally physically fallen over.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-364.wav|I mean, Bob Dole fell off a stage in nineteen ninety six and then Hillary Clinton fell into a van in two thousand sixteen. So it could happen.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-365.wav|I mean, it could happen. I'm not hoping for it. You want everybody to remain healthy, but Joe Biden is obviously not cognitively with it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-366.wav|And so you can, it's hard, honestly, it's kind of hard to watch because just as a human being, you're kind of rooting for him to finish his sentences.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-367.wav|You're rooting for him to somehow come up with a cogent thought. Because it's hard to, I mean, it's like watching the office except not funny.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-368.wav|Right. The office, the awkwardness is the funniness. Here, it's, it's actually not funny cause he's kind of like struggling to get the sentences out and struggling to get the paragraphs out.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-369.wav|And it's, it's really not good. But according to the media, it was a masterful brilliant edifying performance by Joe Biden.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-370.wav|And the reason that it was brilliant and wonderful and edifying is of course, because it was in fact Joe Biden talking and the fact that he was not asked like a single difficult question, that's normal.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-371.wav|According to C N N, Brian Stelter suggested last night, not kidding. Brian Stelter put in his newsletter,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-372.wav|why is it that Joe Biden is basically getting treated with kid gloves? His answer is because Donald Trump has a big, bad orange mean man.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-373.wav|Quote, of course they are treated differently. The notion that Trump should be interviewed in the same fashion as Biden is absurd. Trump has no allegiance to the truth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-374.wav|It shows every single time he is in front of a camera. He lies misleads and promotes conspiracy theories at an unprecedented rate in modern American politics.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-375.wav|So in other words, Trump should be asked difficult question because Trump is a very bad orange mean man who says things that I don't like,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-376.wav|but Joe Biden is a wonderful man who never lies in and has never bloviatee and has never prevaricated,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-377.wav|never committed plagiarism, never exaggerated, never been insulting about Indian Americans.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-378.wav|Never done any like, okay.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-379.wav|So the media have now justified their own failure of journalisming by suggesting in true journalismic fashion that they really can't ask questions to Joe Biden that are tough because Joe Biden is just too wonderful a human being.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-380.wav|Still. Joe Biden does this town hall last night and it gets awkward.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-381.wav|So for example, he was asked specifically about the green new deal. He randomly lost his train of thought in the middle of the answer and talked about ventilating schools, which is a weird thing to do.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-382.wav|Obviously, and then he realizes, Oh wait, this was a question about the green new deal. I probably need to, ventilating schools, making them safer. That's a COVID thing, right? I|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-383.wav|t's not a green, new deal thing. He just loses track in the middle. And there's a lot of this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-384.wav|And he was asked by a woman who was a farmer about overregulation. His answer was something having to do with chicken bleep in Delaware.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-385.wav|Not kidding. It was literally, he had gave answer about chicken manure in Delaware, and the lady is staring at him like,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-386.wav|I don't know what you're talking about, Joe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-387.wav|Here was, here's the, here's the question and answer. Unbelievable.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-388.wav|He is definitely an expert in types of manure and slinging them around, uh, that, that lady's expression.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-389.wav|They just need to close in on her face and then go directly to the curb your enthusiasm credits, because she's like,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-390.wav|what in the F? I was just asking you about like, please don't shut down my farm through your crappy overregulation and your green new deal nonsense.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-391.wav|And he's like, let me tell you about this time. I saw it on the side of the road.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-392.wav|Let me just tell you about this time where I saw, like there was poop and I don't know whether it was like from a Beaver or a dolphin,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-393.wav|but it was on the side of the road and I picked it up and I said to corn pop, why is there poop in my leg hair?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-394.wav|Why? And Everybody's like, whew!! Joe Biden!! Look at that performance. Woo!!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-395.wav|That man is going to be our president for thirty two point seven seconds before Kamala Harris is the president of the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-396.wav|Joe Biden also unleashed a bit of radicalism that the media immediately covered up. So you said he backed the green new deal, but then he backed off it, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-397.wav|This is the way that Joe Biden does it. He's asked specifically about the radical policies of his own party.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-398.wav|And then he says he backs them, but I've also provided an alternative plan that's not quite as radical.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-399.wav|And that way, when Republicans say he backs the green new deal, the media fact check them and say, Oh, but he also said that he has his own plan.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-400.wav|Okay. You can't have it both ways. If he backed the green new deal, you want ninety three trillion dollars in new spending.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-401.wav|Trillion! With a D. But watch your Biden's split the baby here.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-402.wav|Okay. And then he, uh, was asked about China and he was repeatedly asked whether he'd called China and opponent. He would not.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-403.wav|So. You know, the, the fact that Joe Biden says that again, you want to talk about media malfeasance.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-404.wav|The intelligence community came up with the report. It said the Russians would try to interfere in the election again, and they would do so on behalf of Trump.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-405.wav|They also said Iran and China would attempt to interfere with the election on behalf of Joe Biden. Which one of those things have you heard from mainstream media?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-406.wav|Infinitely. Right. Trump won in twenty sixteen because of the Russians. Not true.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-407.wav|Trump won in twenty twump, if he wins, it'll be because of the Russians in twenty twenty. Which country is more powerful and has more propagandistic arms in the United States?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-408.wav|The Chinese government? Or the Russian government?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-409.wav|There's no question. And the Chinese government is apparently attempting to interfere on Biden's behalf, but you never hear about it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-410.wav|Here is Joe Biden saying that he won't call the Chinese an opponent.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-411.wav|They're they're, they're more like a competitor, you know, they're not really an opponent, even though they are actively engaging in human rights abuses.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-412.wav|They're actively subjecting formerly free States like Hong Kong to, to abject tyranny.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-413.wav|They are, they are clearly attempting aggressive action in the South China sea directed at Japan and Taiwan.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-414.wav|They are creating a belt and road program designed to minimize Western influence and to maximize their own.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-415.wav|But Joe Biden won't call them an opponent no matter what, but he don't worry, he's going to be strong on China guys.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-416.wav|And then of course he futzed on fracking because he doesn't want to lose Pennsylvania.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-417.wav|But also he has pledged to basically end fracking, he says no new licenses, which of course means, pretty quickly,  the end of fracking.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-418.wav|Here was Joe Biden trying to split the baby once again.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-419.wav|Okay. So no, don't worry. We're not going to, we're not going to get rid of your fracking job right now.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-420.wav|We're just going to make sure that nobody can ever get a new fracking job and then we're gonna regulate it out of existence.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-421.wav|Now, the truth is that Joe Biden's campaign really relies on two things. One, orange man, bad, and the other is, orange man responsible for everybody dying from COVID.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-422.wav|And this is the case where Biden is, is going to have the strongest case, mainly because he's not in power.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-423.wav|See the thing about being in power when there's a massive pandemic, Is that pretty much every game, everybody gets shellacked.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-424.wav|Or at least they should be if the media weren't completely full of it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-425.wav|Right? Apparently Andrew Cuomo escapes all censure despite the fact that his state got just reamed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-426.wav|Apparently the the governor of New Jersey gets away with it, even though his state got absolutely creamed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-427.wav|But bottom line is that you can blame Trump for everything. And that's what Biden proceeded to do last night.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-428.wav|He said that, uh, the virus is costing us, our freedoms. Well, actually right now it's lockdowns that are costing us our freedoms, not the virus itself.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-429.wav|Because if people wore masks in public places and they're young and they're not sick, we could all be back at work right now. And in fact that is what we should be pursuing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-430.wav|In fact, that is what most peace, places in Europe are pursuing right now.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-431.wav|But according to Joe Biden, it's only the virus. The virus is the only reason why we're locked down, not actual formal lockdowns in many, many States, including California, where literally half of the unemployed now live.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-432.wav|Then he proceeded to hold in-person rallies up until the first week of March. March!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-433.wav|At no point, did you call for universal masking in February. At no point did you call for lockdowns in February.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-434.wav|At no point did anybody do any of that stuff. This revisionist history whereby Democrats just don't exist in the narrative is truly incredible.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-435.wav|Joe Biden actually made the claim yesterday that if Trump had done his job, every single human being who has died from COVID would still be alive.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-436.wav|That is patently nuts. I mean like there's no evidence this is the case at all.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-437.wav|You are making that up! There is no evidence that that is the case. None!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-438.wav|If the president had done his job since the beginning, you held rallies until March, ya doof!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-439.wav|Kay, but of course, again, it's very easy to sit outside because, when a bad thing happens and the person in power is in power, you can easily blame them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-440.wav|And if you're the media, you just go right along with it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-441.wav|Then of course, Joe Biden jumped on it, William Barr. So William Barr is the attorney general of course.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-442.wav|And yesterday bar gave a speech talking about, uh, at Hillsdale college, talking about the D O J,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-443.wav|and in the middle of his Q and a, he was talking about the COVID lockdowns. And he said they were radical intrusion on Liberty.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-444.wav|So let's actually play the clip of bill BARR. So you get the full context as to what he's saying here.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-445.wav|So it was the slavery reference that of course he's getting hit over.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-446.wav|He was not comparing the moral quandary of slavery and the moral evil of slavery to the morality of lockdowns, ya idiots.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-447.wav|He's explicitly denouncing that. He's explicitly taking that and saying slavery to the side, which is a whole different issue because of its inherent moral, evil.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-448.wav|Right, that, that putting that issue aside, if you're just talking about restrictions on daily movement by Americans, this is the greatest restriction on daily movement by Americans in American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-449.wav|Which by the numbers is essentially true. He's explicitly saying it's not like slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-450.wav|And so the media go, well, he's comparing it to slavery. And then they asked Joe Biden, and it's like, Joe, what are you, here? Here's a brick.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-451.wav|Would you like to hit William Barr with it?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-452.wav|In that sentence, he said you lost your freedom because you didn't act. You lost your freedom!|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-453.wav|He's saying that it's a restriction. You lost your, you lost your freedom.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-454.wav|Seems like a restriction on Liberty. Also. He deliberately did not compare it to slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-455.wav|He explicitly took slavery and put it to the side. And so Joe Biden who apparently doesn't speak English or is wildly dishonest or both, is like, no, he was comparing it to slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-456.wav|He was absolutely a hundred percent not comparing it to slavery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-457.wav|If I say to you that other than this thing, this is a really bad thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-458.wav|Here. Like other than, here's a really bad thing that's happening.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-459.wav|And other than this much worse and very different thing. This is a very bad thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-460.wav|That is not me saying the two things are equivalent, it's me deliberately disassociating the two things, ya morons.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-461.wav|Okay. But again, Joe Biden, he was treated with kid gloves, by the way, Politico, Politico put out an actual tweet in which they admitted this. Right.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-462.wav|Here's Politico's tweet. If A B C's event with president Trump was an icy grilling, C N N's drive in conversation with Joe Biden yesterday was more like an affable reunion of old acquaintances.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-463.wav|Yeah, no bleep. And that is pretty damned obvious. Affable acquaintance between old, old friends.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-464.wav|Yeah. I got that. I got that C N N, the most trusted name in news.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-465.wav|Meanwhile, I do love the, the democratic take on COVID, which again is the focal point of their campaign.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-466.wav|Their take is vaccines are bad if they're developed under the Trump administration.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-467.wav|Also Republican governors are extremely bad. Also blue governors are extremely good.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-468.wav|And if you distinguish between red and blue and you're a Republican, you are also extremely bad. So that is the line right here.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-469.wav|So the, the pro science crew, here's Joe Biden yesterday saying that he doesn't trust Trump on the vaccine.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-470.wav|No. One's asking you to trust Trump on the vaccine. Trump ain't the one handing out the vaccine or developing the vaccine.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-471.wav|You know what we're asking you to do? Trust all of the departments inside the federal government.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-472.wav|Whose AB, who's absolute task. Do you trust Redfield? Do you trust Fauci? Do you trust Birx?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-473.wav|Do you trust, do you trust the doctors who you've been lighting votive candles to?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-474.wav|For months at this point, here's Joe Biden talking down vaccines.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-475.wav|It's amazing. This is, this is the party that says that they are all in favor of the science and all in favor of ending the problems of COVID as soon as possible,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-476.wav|talking down one of the chief ways, we're going to end that problem, which is the development of a vaccine.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-477.wav|Okay. Um, so who do you think is going to be making the next, but here's the problem?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-478.wav|When you say you don't trust the vaccine as long as Trump is in office, what you really mean is you don't trust the vaccine until Trump is out of office, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-479.wav|Because your implication is that Trump is pressuring the scientists to botch this thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-480.wav|Meanwhile, Democrats went nuts yesterday because Trump, during a presser, he pointed out that if you don't count the blue States and how they've handled this thing, that the numbers are actually a lot better.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-481.wav|Now. That's true. It's not supremely helpful.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-482.wav|Right. Because again, nobody really knew how to deal with the pandemic very well in the beginning.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-483.wav|The only real activity you can fault people for is what should have been obvious from the beginning,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-484.wav|which is protect the people in nursing homes, protect the elderly, protect the vulnerable, which everybody failed to do in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, et cetera.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-485.wav|But let's be real about this.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-486.wav|The division between red States and blue States on COVID has been pushed by the media and pushed by the Democrats since the very beginning.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-487.wav|Ron de Santis was evil for not shutting down Jacksonville beaches.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-488.wav|Doug Ducey was evil for not, for not fully shutting down the economy of arizona.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-489.wav|Kristi Noem in South Dakota is still evil for not having shut down South Dakota, which by the way, currently has a four point eight percent unemployment rate and not tons of death.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-490.wav|So it was, it was Democrats who decided to make this a red blue issue.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-491.wav|I've said since the beginning, I don't understand why this should be a red, blue issue. You should actually follow the best scientific procedures.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-492.wav|And then you should alleviate lockdown when it appears that lockdown is no longer achieving what it was originally supposed to achieve, namely, avoiding the overwhelm of the hospitals.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-493.wav|I'm the one who's been saying since the beginning that you should follow the actual recommendations of people who are, who are examining the data.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-494.wav|It was Democrats who immediately went to red States are mishandling this and blue States, they were saying that while ron De santis  had no cases in Florida.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-495.wav|Okay. But meanwhile, Democrats are very angry that Trump mentioned the difference between red States and blue States in terms of deaths per million.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-496.wav|And by the way, out of the top eleven places in the United States, including D C, deaths per million, I believe eight of them are blue just for the record.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-497.wav|Here is Chuck Schumer saying that Trump is monstrous and demented for distinguishing blue States, which is weird because I'm old enough to remember when the Democrats were saying that all the red States were monstrous and demented for even opening.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-498.wav|The Atlantic ran a headline about Georgia saying that it was Brian Kemp's experiment in human sacrifice to reopen Georgia.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-499.wav|Here is uh Chuck Schumer. The American lives don't count. No one did that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-500.wav|I mean, if anybody has degraded American lives in places like New York, by the way, it was Andrew Cuomo who built a paper machie mountain of death as tribute to himself to show how wonderful he had handled it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-501.wav|He made a poster to himself with a curve showing dead people. Making light of death.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-502.wav|Also, do you remember the D N C? It wasn't that long ago, they literally took a woman whose dad died of COVID, and voted for Trump,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-503.wav|and said he was an idiot and it was his own fault he died because he listened to Donald Trump.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-504.wav|They degraded the value of every Trump supporter who died of covid by basically saying they brought it on themselves.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-505.wav|Meanwhile, James Cliburn makes a completely unbased accusation saying that Trump refused to act on COVID because it was hitting blue States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-506.wav|Like I'm going to need some evidence that it was specifically because Trump hates the blue States that he was not acting on COVID. By the way, he gave all the ventilators that New York needed to New York.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-507.wav|Gavin Newsome said he gave us all the resources we needed. Jay Inslee in Washington said he gave us all the resources we needed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-508.wav|But here's, Jim's Cliburn suggesting that Trump just allowed people in blue States to die. Oh, well, if you say so, James.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-509.wav|Okay. Again, the reason that they didn't implement a national strategy is because America is a nation with lots of States and not all the States were being hit equivalently.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-510.wav|And so a national strategy would have forced States that were not being hit to shut down, which would have been very silly.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-511.wav|You should not shut down States that don't have any cases.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-512.wav|Okay. Now this doesn't mean that the white house handled everything with regard to COVID properly.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-513.wav|There's a story yesterday that I think actually is probably the most damaging story that I've seen on the Trump administration's handling of COVID, is from business insider,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-514.wav|talking about how the white house scuttled the plan to partner with the u s postal service to send every American a face mask.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-515.wav|The Washington post found a, a draft press release showing the postal service was preparing to send out six hundred fifty million face masks in April to supply every household with them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-516.wav|That would have been a good idea by the way. That woulda been a very good idea, because I've always been very baffled by the sort of conservative notion that in order to reopen, we have to take off the mask.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-517.wav|It was sort of the opposite. If you want to reopen, then people should have been wearing masks.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-518.wav|Uh, I've been saying that since the beginning, do the social distancing and wear the mask so we can reopen and get back to normal.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-519.wav|And then the virus slowly works its way through the community and then you're done.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-520.wav|And in fact, that's kind of what happened in places like Florida and Arizona and Texas and Georgia, and the masking rate went up as the virus went up.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-521.wav|So that was a mistake. Obviously. And mistakes clearly were made by the Trump administration.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-522.wav|But again, the, the, the notion that Democrats would have handled this tons better, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting to see any evidence of that at all, at all, at all at all.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-523.wav|Okay. So, I do want to make a quick note here that tonight is Roshashana. So Rashana is the beginning of the Jewish new year.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-524.wav|And so I want to talk for just a minute about Roshashana. Uh, because it is a very meaningful time in Jewish life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-525.wav|And, and frankly, I think it has some, some things to teach everybody about, uh, the nature of the universe in which we live.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-526.wav|So the Jewish new year happens starting tonight.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-527.wav|It carries on for two days. It's sort of different from the American new year or the world new year in that during the American new year, you, you're drinking, you're merry.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-528.wav|Uh, and then you sort of make resolutions for the new year. The Jewish new year is about two things. It's about celebrating God's creation of the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-529.wav|And it's about leading off what are called the asserya mechuva, which are the ten days of repentance.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-530.wav|So you have ten days to sort of get your life straight before Yom Kippor, which is the day of repentance, which we, I'll be taking off a day in ten days, uh, to, to fast and pray for repentance.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-531.wav|And, and the idea here is that you have basically, uh, on the repentance side, you have ten days to sort of demonstrate to God that you would like to fix your problems.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-532.wav|And, you know, it's a beautiful idea, but the cheat we'll get to, maybe I'll talk about Yom Kippor on near Yom Kippur,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-533.wav|but when it comes to Rosh Hashanah the create, the idea of God's creation of the universe being celebrated, the Bria as it's called in Hebrew at the beginning of Genesis, that, that in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-534.wav|Why is that an important idea? Well, it's an important idea for a variety of reasons.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-535.wav|First of all, it means that man is central to the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-536.wav|That doesn't mean that we are literally living at the center of the universe as pre Copernican theory sort of suggested.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-537.wav|It doesn't mean that man is completely disconnected from the animal world.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-538.wav|What it does mean is that human beings create meaning in the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-539.wav|This is why when people say, you know, that the earth would be better off without us, what does the earth care, the are the, the earth has no sentience.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-540.wav|What does it matter whether the trees feel better without human beings?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-541.wav|Human beings are meaning creating creatures and thus meaning in the universe Springs into existence with the creation of sentient human beings.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-542.wav|So God's creation of the universe. In that way, the universe was made for man to provide meaning in the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-543.wav|And so God's creation of man lends meaning to, to the entire creation itself.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-544.wav|God's creation of the universe culminates with man. See, there's something beautiful about the biblical story of creation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-545.wav|It does two things. One, it reminds human beings that they are nothing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-546.wav|And two, it reminds human beings that they are everything.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-547.wav|It reminds human beings that they are created from the earth, and back to the earth they will return.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-548.wav|They're human beings in the creation story in Genesis are created on the sixth day of creation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-549.wav|They don't have their own separate day of creation, right? God creates the animals and it creates human beings at the very end of the sixth day,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-550.wav|meaning that we are innately, wrapped up in our own animal instincts, but we have the capacity to look up to the stars.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-551.wav|Meaning rests in us. And if we failed to take advantage of that, meaning then we are degraded to the level of animals.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-552.wav|The importance of God creation, and we should be grateful for the fact that that God created the universe the way that he did.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-553.wav|We should be grateful for this universe, which is not always easy to be.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-554.wav|I mean, it's a tough universe to live in sometimes, but we should be very grateful for the fact that God finds you in the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-555.wav|This is the argument that, that religious people often make for the existence of God and trying to evidence God in the universe is that the conditions had to be incredibly precise in order for human beings to arise.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-556.wav|And in fact, there was a recent study showing that of ten million stars that have been surveyed that we've seen essentially no signs of any other form of anything like sentient human beings or sentient creatures, literally anywhere.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-557.wav|The, the conditions for the creation of life have to be extraordinarily precise.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-558.wav|And atheists will say, well, you know, If you run the same game over and over and over, then eventually you come up with life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-559.wav|And so they posit things like multiple universe theory, that there's tons of universes an infinite number of universes, actually.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-560.wav|And so if there are an infinite number of universes, then every possibility is possible in every universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-561.wav|The evidence for multiple universities is zero because you can't get outside your own universe to actually examine whether there are multiple universes, which means that that's an act of faith as well.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-562.wav|The fine tuning of the universe for human life is indeed proof that something wants, something wants us to be here.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-563.wav|And that is something that is worth noting.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-564.wav|Now that the counter argument is that, you know, if you're the one guy who wins the lottery, then you think that the lottery picked you out.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-565.wav|Okay but that assumes that there's a winner in the lottery.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-566.wav|There didn't have to be a winner in the lottery. Whenever there's a lottery, you assume there will be one winner.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-567.wav|It just happens to be you this time. But in this universe, there's no reason why there has to be life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-568.wav|It could be a coincidence is when you have this many things lining up this way, uh, it, it tends toward the conclusion that it is not.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-569.wav|Now, put aside sort of the religious arguments for a second. What is the value of believing on a human level that God created the universe?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-570.wav|A few things. One, if you are a scientifically minded person, then you tend to believe that the universe operates by understandable rules.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-571.wav|You also tend to believe in things like objective truth. That outside of you, there is a truth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-572.wav|That not all truth is about your subjective perception of the truth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-573.wav|And that your mind can grasp these truths.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-574.wav|There's nothing in simple materialism that suggests any of these things. Objective truth does not exist in a world of pure materialism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-575.wav|You're simply an evolved creature who is capable of adapting to your environment.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-576.wav|That doesn't mean that the way you adapt is true, it means that you adapt in the most adaptable way.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-577.wav|But if you believe there is such a thing as objective truth, you have to explain why there is such a thing as objective truth outside of you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-578.wav|Why are there rules that we as human beings, very, very limited creatures can actually understand and utilize to our advantage?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-579.wav|And it's not just that we are utilizing them to our advantage in ways that are sort of practical.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-580.wav|It's that we can understand objectively true things. How do you believe in an objective truth if you don't believe that there's anything setting that objective truth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-581.wav|Adaptability and environmental adaptation do not equal objective truth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-582.wav|So the idea that God created the universe with certain understandable rules leads inevitably to the idea that the human being has the capacity to understand many of those rules.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-583.wav|So it leads to the impetus for science, because science is about the investigation of those objective rules and objective truths.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-584.wav|It suggests discernable rules in the universe. And, on a human level, it also suggests that human beings have incredible worth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-585.wav|Right? The biblical account of creation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-586.wav|I've said this before the single most important verse in the Bible is that God created human beings in his image.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-587.wav|It doesn't mean that God looks like human beings.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-588.wav|What it means is that God created us with the ability to reason. God created us with the ability to create.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-589.wav|And that we owe each other recognition that we are each made in God's image.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-590.wav|You can't enslave somebody if you believe that they are made in the image of God.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-591.wav|You can't mistreat somebody if you believe that they are made in the image of God.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-592.wav|Enlightenment values of individualism and individual rights Spring directly from the idea that you are made in the image of God.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-593.wav|Because, on a pure materialistic level, who cares? You're just a, you're just a ball of meat wandering through the universe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-594.wav|So the idea of God's creation lends weight to the, to the statements of the declaration of independence, which is of course why Jefferson,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-595.wav|who had a, a sort of complicated relationship with organized religion at the very best, suggest that our rights lie inevitably in, in a creator or nature.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-596.wav|Now what that means in the end, and this is how it connects to, to the ten days of repentance is that we do have responsibilities to the one who created us.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-597.wav|Just like you have responsibilities to your parents. You have responsibilities to the one who created us. Who gave us a mind to comprehend the universe around us.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-598.wav|He did that so that we could seek truth and act morally.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-599.wav|God created us with a moral sense, right? This is the kantian statement that the best evidence of God is the starry heavens above and the moral sense within.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-600.wav|We have the capacity to understand the universe. We have the capacity to Intuit moral laws from looking at the universe around us.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-601.wav|It is the idea of natural law, which inevitably, well not inevitably, eventually gives rise to the idea of natural rights, that rights lie within you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-602.wav|The birth of the enlightenment, the birth of science, the birth of all the things that you believe in, whether you're a secular humanist living in the United States, or whether you're a religious person,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-603.wav|lie in the basic idea that God created the universe and that's what we're celebrating here on Rosh Hashanah.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-604.wav|So with that said, Shanah Tovah, lumen tukah, meaning a sweet and happy new year to you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-605.wav|And we'll see you here a little later today for a couple additional hours, or we'll see you here next week. I'm Ben Shapiro. This is the Ben Shapiro show.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-12.wav|Okay, so. It is kind of fascinating that in America's narrative discourse, there's a, oh, a lie that is told.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-13.wav|It goes something like this, the great threat to American democracy lies on the authoritarian right.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-14.wav|The authoritarian right is the biggest threat to American democracy. This is something that you hear very often in the media. You hear it a lot from Democratic Congresspeople. And they like to use as their example, what happened on January sixth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-15.wav|Now, January sixth was an act of criminality. It was an act of evil.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-16.wav|And, there was something authoritarian people attempting to stop the democratic processes from taking place and going forward and working, for sure.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-17.wav|You don't have to deny the presence of an authoritarian right to also recognize that the centers of power in American life,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-18.wav|the centers of institutional power in American life do not lie with the authoritarian right.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-19.wav|They lie with the authoritarian left. Now it is worthwhile at this point to define our terms.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-20.wav|So the, uh, the very term, authoritarianism, is very often used kind of vaguely.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-21.wav|What exactly does it mean to be authoritarian? People use it simultaneously to mean fascist and totalitarian.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-22.wav|Authoritarian has a little bit more of a specific definition typically when you are talking about the characteristics of authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-23.wav|So let's talk about that for a second. So there've been a bunch of studies on what authoritarianism actually looks like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-24.wav|What does it mean to be authoritarian? So there's a guy named Theodore Adorno and he, very early in nineteen fifty, wrote a book.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-25.wav|He was a Frankfurt school member. He's a Marxist theorist. And he wrote a book about authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-26.wav|And his basic suggestion is that authoritarianism was a naturally right-wing phenomenon. See, as a Marxist, of course, he thought that anybody who disagreed with him was sort of an authoritarian.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-27.wav|His idea is that America was right for the plucking. America was about to fall into authoritarianism because America wasn't left-wing enough.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-28.wav|Because he wrote this very famous book called, The Authoritarian Personality, in which, essentially, he suggested that antisemitism and authoritarianism were outgrowths of a particular mindset that also sprang from capitalism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-29.wav|Now this was untrue, but it did lead to a lot of study as to what an authoritarian personality would look like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-30.wav|And there was a Harvard social scientist named Robert Altemeyer. He created a right-wing authoritarianism scale. He was attempting to detect three particular character traits.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-31.wav|These were character traits of the authoritarians. Character trait number one of an authoritarian was authoritarian submission,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-32.wav|willingness to submit to established and legitimate authorities where you're willing to just go along with whatever the boss says.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-33.wav|Two, authoritarian aggression where you're going to perform aggressive act on behalf of the authoritarian.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-34.wav|And three, conventionalism where you are going to abide by all of the approved social conventions. This is right-wing authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-35.wav|And for a long time, social scientists who tend to be very left-wing thought there was no such thing as left-wing authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-36.wav|Left-wing authoritarianism just did not exist because left-wingers were progressive and wonderful and anti-violent and pacifistic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-37.wav|Okay, well, it is very clear at this point there is left-wing authoritarianism and, in fact, social scientists have found that left-wing authoritarianism is quite common.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-38.wav|When University of Montana social psychologist, Lucian Conway, created a scale to mirror Atemeyer's scale, what he found is that the highest score for authoritarianism was for liberals and liberals had the highest score for authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-39.wav|And he described authoritarianism this way. Right, here is, here is what they said, that this particular social scientist from University of Montana,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-40.wav|about what left-wing authoritarian must look like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-41.wav|Left-wing authoritarianism. If right-wing authoritarianism was about submission, and aggression approved by the bosses,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-42.wav|and conventionalism, a belief that your traditional morality is the only approved social convention and that you get to shut down everything else.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-43.wav|Then left-wing authoritarianism is sort of the mirror image. Left-wing authoritarianism believes in revolutionary aggression and the system has to be torn down. The hierarchy of power has to be destroyed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-44.wav|Top-down censorship, they simultaneously believe in. In order to achieve utopia, you have to shut everybody else up.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-45.wav|And finally, anti-conventionalism, which these social scientists described as, quote,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-46.wav|reflecting a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissals of conservatives as inherently immoral.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-47.wav|And intolerance desire for coercively imposing left-wing beliefs and values on others and a need for social and ideological homogeneity in one's environment.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-48.wav|In other words, they're going to cram down a particular moral worldview that says that you are evil because you disagree. So those are the three characteristics of left-wing authoritarianism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-49.wav|Revolutionary aggression and approval for, which you saw over the summer when, virtually, the entire left-wing winked and nodded at the most damaging riots in American history.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-50.wav|Top-down censorship directed at group authority, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-51.wav|The group authority, as a means of regulating right-wing beliefs and behaviors, we have to have the bosses shut everybody else up.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-52.wav|Right, this is the diversity training you see it inside your corporations or as we will see Democrats in Congress, trying to shut down free speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-53.wav|And anti-conventionalism, a belief that everybody who disagrees with you is inherently a moral lesser person, a morally lesser person, a bad person.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-54.wav|These characteristics, these characteristics of left-wing authoritarianism are extraordinarily common. Not only are they common, they are dominant in our institutional culture.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-55.wav|Dominance and you see it every single day, those particular factors. You see it at work every single day. So when people say, you know, right-wing authoritarianism is dominant.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-56.wav|Again, you don't have to deny the presence of right-wing authoritarianism to recognize that the institutional power in our country is dominated by authoritarian leftist, who seeks top-down censorship.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-57.wav|Who believed that their progressive worldview is the only worldview that matters and who believed in a revolutionary aggression designed at tearing down the, quote-unquote, hierarchies of power.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-58.wav|That describes to a T what so many members of the democratic party are doing today.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-59.wav|The reason I bring this up is because two members of Congress have now issued a series of letters to a variety of, of.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-60.wav|Platforms and common carriers designed to shut down dissent.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-61.wav|One member of Congress is named Anna Eshoo. The other is named Jerry McNerney. They issued this letter and this is just full authoritarian stuff.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-62.wav|We have a First Amendment for a reason. It says, Congress shall make no law. Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-63.wav|So what have our members of Congress decided to do? Instead of making a law, they're going to essentially create agents in the private sphere to do their bidding.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-64.wav|They know they can't pass a law that abridges freedom of speech or it'll get struck down by the Supreme Court.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-65.wav|Instead, what they do is they say, we will punish you. If you do not do the censorship we wish you to do in the private sphere.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-66.wav|This is the new model, not top-down censorship just from government, but top-down censorship.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-67.wav|With government actors using as a cudgel, their power, in order to beat corporations into submission.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-68.wav|And force those corporations to adopt the precept of the authoritarian left and to sensor from the top.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-69.wav|We'll get to what I mean by this in just one second because we really are living in an authoritarian time, right? This is an authoritarian moment that we were watching unfold before us right now.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-70.wav|And it is deep and it is threatening and it has been creeping in American life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-71.wav|And, unfortunately, the authoritarianism of the left was fostered in general and in very strong ways by the reactions to things like January sixth.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-72.wav|That was an opportunity for the authoritarian left to get the upper hand in American discourse because free speech is now bad. Free exchange of ideas is now bad. It could be incitement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-73.wav|If you say something they don't like, it could be dangerous. And so, now is a great time to shut down free speech, to shut down individual rights and to use all powers that they have at their disposal in order to do so.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-74.wav|I'll explain in just one second, because again, the fact that this is, is happening in the United States should scare the living hell out of everybody who believes in individual rights, right, left or center.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-75.wav|I'm not saying everybody on the left is a member of the authoritarian left. I'm saying there is an authoritarian left and it is becoming the dominant mode in the democratic party.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-76.wav|And that's a very frightening thing. Get to more of it in one second. First, let us talk about the fact that you don't want to go to an auto parts store because why would you? What's so great about an auto parts store?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-77.wav|You're just going to stand in line, then you're gonna get to the front of the line.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-78.wav|Then finally, they're going to tell you that they have to order the part online, and then they're going to upcharge you for it. Instead, here is something you could do. You could just skip the middleman.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-79.wav|Why not just go to rock auto dot com? It's much easier than walking into the store and people demanding quick answers and then, ordering the part online. Instead, just go to rockauto.com and get the part yourself.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-80.wav|Rock auto dot com always offers the lowest prices possible rather than changing prices based on what the market will bear, the way that airlines do. Why would you spend up to twice as much for the same parts?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-81.wav|Let's say, hypothetically, you have a need, like, I don't know, a Delphi FG fourteen fifty six fuel pump assembly for two thousand five to two thousand ten Honda Odyssey. I don't know why that just popped in my head, but, but it did.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-82.wav|It costs, like, three hundred and fifty four bucks at a big chain store. That's the kind of thing you could get at Rock Auto for two hundred and seventeen bucks.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-83.wav|Rock auto dot com is a family business serving auto parts customers online for twenty years.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-84.wav|Head on over to rock auto dot com to shop for auto and body parts from hundreds of manufacturers. Best of all, prices at rock auto dot com are always reliably low and the same for professionals and do-it yourselfers.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-85.wav|So head on over to rock auto dot com right now. They've got amazing selection, reliably low prices, all the parts of your car will ever need, rock auto dot com|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-86.wav|head on over, write Shapiro in their how did you hear about us box. So they know that we sent you. rock auto dot com. Go check them out.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-87.wav|Okay. So these two members of Congress have now issued a series of letters.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-88.wav|Two common carriers telling them they want them to essentially boot Fox News off the air and O A N N and Newsmax.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-89.wav|And this is the same sort of top-down censorship that you are seeing called for by our establishment media.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-90.wav|Again, social media, right? Let's force social media not to disseminate information we don't like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-91.wav|And there are a variety of games they play in order to shut down and stuff they don't like. You'll notice one of the things that they've done, and this is a pretty clever, slight of hand.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-92.wav|A lot of this debate really started after the two thousand sixteen election. In fact, nearly all of it. Before two thousand sixteen, there's a basic acknowledgement that there were alternative points of view that were going to be presented online.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-93.wav|There are alternative points of views were going to be presented on podcast and talk radio, and that was annoying to the left, but they understood that, you know, you sort of had to just deal with it.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-94.wav|And then after twenty sixteen, there was this moment where the left decided, you know what, we don't, we shouldn't have lost that election. In fact, we didn't lose that election.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-95.wav|The only reason we lost that election is because of Russian disinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-96.wav|Now this information, you know, foreign intervention. Using false information in order to pervert the political process,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-97.wav|is in fact, not something that, that the government has to just leave alone.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-98.wav|A foreign disinformation is something that government can step into.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-99.wav|It does have First Amendment consequences, but there is some precedent for the government stepping in and stopping foreign actual interference with disinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-100.wav|But you'll notice that there's a verbal slight of hand that went on, where the media and Democratic members of Congress and Democrats in power.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-101.wav|They decided to shift from Russian disinformation to misinformation. Now there's a difference between disinformation and misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-102.wav|Disinformation is active promotion of false material by a foreign government. That's what this information typically is, right? You do disinformation on, on the Soviets or the Soviets do disinformation on you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-103.wav|Misinformation is information that you perceive to be mistaken. There's no obvious intent for somebody to lie. It just something you perceive to be mistaken.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-104.wav|And so what the left does is they declare everything they don't like, misinformation. If there's a narrative they don't like, that's misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-105.wav|So they've now shifted over from fringe sort of issues when it comes to speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-106.wav|Of foreign disinformation, the Russian Government promulgating falsehoods in the middle of an election, to core political speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-107.wav|Which they then term,  misinformation. And then, they set up a whole body of fact-checkers,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-108.wav|whose sole design apparently is to label anything they don't like. Not only misinformation, but mostly false.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-109.wav|And this is what you see at PolitiFact. PolitiFact will label Barack Obama statement that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Half true for several years and then only later will they be like, oh yeah, that was the lie of the year.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-110.wav|It becomes misinformation when it is convenient for them. And then they use those fake fact-checkers.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-111.wav|Those pseudo fact-checkers as an excuse to shut down outlets they don't like on social media and to suppress their reach or they go to YouTube and they say, you know what?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-112.wav|We know that there are a lot of people out there who like conservative material, but we are afraid that that conservative material will lead to incitement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-113.wav|How? Well, it's not even that those people are doing anything that incites violence, not that Jordan Peterson does anything that incites violence.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-114.wav|It's that you might watch Jordan Peterson video, and then maybe, you'll get dragged into a rabbit hole of right-wing extremism.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-115.wav|Okay. So, so they couldn't, they're consistently broadening out exceptions under American law that do exist to free speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-116.wav|And then they're letting the exception eat the rule, right? So they will say, incitement is illegal. It's true. Incitement is illegal.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-117.wav|Then they will say, that's stuff that you're saying, you know, like normal political stuff, that's incitement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-118.wav|Or they will say, yeah, we understand that missing that, that, you know, your narrative is  opinion and it's protected, but it's really misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-119.wav|And misinformation is really kind of like disinformation. And disinformation is something that the government can fight. So really your speeches is like Russian disinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-120.wav|Hey, this is the way that the left goes about their top-down censorship.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-121.wav|And it is tied into an ideology that suggests revolutionary aggression against the system because the system of individual rights is inherently discriminatory, according to the woke left.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-122.wav|The woke left says that individual rights are biased because the people who are in a position, to best exercise their individual rights are the powerful in our society.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-123.wav|And those people must be brought to heal.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-124.wav|So individual rights, take a back seat to what the collective requires. Individual rights, take a backseat to equity.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-125.wav|And this is the language that you hear from the left.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-126.wav|Again, these are the elements of authoritarianism, revolutionary aggression, top-down censorship. And certainly the most prevalent feeling on the left is that if you disagree with them, it is because you are immoral lessor.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-127.wav|It is because there's something wrong with you. It is because you believe in brutality, you're a phobe, right? You're a racist, sexist, picket homophobe.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-128.wav|You're somebody who look, you're a hater. And the authoritarianism in the, on the left in the United States is very, very dominant at this point in American life.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-129.wav|And it's becoming more dominant every day. So here's this letter from these two members of Congress, again, directed at taking down political opponents. Here's a letter to John Stanley, Stankey rather.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-130.wav|Stankey is the C E O of A T and T. Dear Mister stankey, and again, this comes from two sitting members of Congress.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-131.wav|Our country's public discourse is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies. Look at that. Look at the conflation there.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-132.wav|Some of those things like Russian disinformation or things the government has a say in. Misinformation is not because you can define that however you want.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-133.wav|Conspiracy theories, depends on what you think is a conspiracy theory, right ?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-134.wav|And lies, well, I mean, the left lied throughout the summer that America's police are systemically racist. They don't seem to care about that lie very much.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-135.wav|These phenomena undergird the radicalization of seditious individuals, who committed active insurrection on January sixth,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-136.wav|and it contributes to a growing distrust of public health measures necessary to crush the pandemic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-137.wav|Right. So the idea here is that we would have crushed the pandemic if it were not for misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-138.wav|Uh, weird because every single democratic member of Congress, so far as I'm aware of, backed mass protest in the middle of a pandemic because they said that racial issues were a public health problem.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-139.wav|In any case, these members of Congress said, we are concerned about the role A T and T plays in disseminating misinformation. Misinformation, again, it's that slight of hand.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-140.wav|Misinformation to millions of it's Uverse, DirecTV, and A T and T T V subscribers. And we write to you today to request additional information about what actions A T and T is taking to address these issues.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-141.wav|Now, notice. Congress does not have the power to regulate A T and T into shutting down free speech. That'd be a violation of the First Amendment.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-142.wav|So instead, they will send nasty threatening letters to places like Comcast and A T and T and they will basically say, you know, nice company you got there.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-143.wav|It'd be a real shame if something happened to it, real shame.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-144.wav|If something happened to A T and T over there. You know, we, you know, we, we have been looking into, like, these other, you know, sort of anti-trust issues.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-145.wav|And I can tell you that if you weren't doing this, this fostering of misinformation, well, then maybe we would stop looking into that. I'm not threatening you or anything, of course.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-146.wav|It's not a threat. And this, this is the way. This is the way the game is played now. Nearly half of Americans get their news primarily from T V, say, these two members of Congress.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-147.wav|However, not all T V news sources are the same. Some purported news outlets have long been misinformation rumor mills and conspiracy theory hotbeds that produce content that leads to real harm.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-148.wav|Now we get the incitements, argument, right? Is, if there's information that you don't like or if there are even things that are not true that are said that you don't like, then those aren't necessarily incitement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-149.wav|That's not true. Lots of things are said in American public discourse every day. And we have laws against things like slander and libel.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-150.wav|So you can sue people based on some of the things, some of those things. We have incitement statutes that are on the books. Those incitement statutes require actual incitement, not just people saying things that are false.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-151.wav|You will also note that these Democrats have no problem with the radical level of things that are not true being said on places like C N N and M S N B C.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-152.wav|For full-on a year, we heard that Andrew Cuomo was the greatest governor on planet earth. C N N reported that the kids from Covington Catholic were vicious racists.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-153.wav|Covington, the, the, the mainstream establishment media, pushed the idea that Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-154.wav|None of those things ended up being true. Doesn't matter, right? It's only one type of, quote-unquote, misinformation you'll know that they're very upset about.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-155.wav|Misinformation on T V has led to our current polluted information environment that radicalizes individuals to commit seditious acts|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-156.wav|and rejects public health best practices among other issues in our public discourse.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-157.wav|And so, again, the, the idea is that if you allow things I don't like then the public discourse is polluted.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-158.wav|Okay well, it may very well be polluted. Seriously. I'll acknowledge that there's information in the public discourse that I think pollutes the public discourse.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-159.wav|For example, if a member of the  S N L cast puts out the overt lie that the state of Israel has been not handing out vaccines to its Arab citizens.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-160.wav|That seems like something that pollutes the public discourse. Do I have any rights to call for S N L to be canceled on that basis? Should I call for?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-161.wav|If I were a member of Congress, would I have the ability, constitutionally speaking, to regulate that? Of course, not. There's a lot of stuff in the public discourse that is chaff.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-162.wav|And then there are some that is wheat and it is your job to distinguish between the two.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-163.wav|But the authoritarian left believes it is their job to distinguish for you and then use their power to cram down in censorious fashion exactly what they like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-164.wav|So, say these Congresspeople experts have noted that the right-wing media ecosystem is, quote-unquote, much more susceptible to disinformation, lies, and half-truths.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-165.wav|Well, I mean, if they say so, then that. Wow. I mean, amazing how they came to that conclusion. It's just the right-wing media ecosystem that's susceptible to disinformation, lies, and half-truths.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-166.wav|Doesn't matter that for four long years, a vast bulk of Democrats believed that the twenty sixteen election was stolen.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-167.wav|Right-wing media outlets like Newsmax, One American News Network, and Fox news all aired misinformation about the November twenty twenty elections.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-168.wav|For example, both Newsmax and O A N N ran quote, incendiary reports and false information following the elections|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-169.wav|and continued to support an angry and dangerous subculture that will continue to operate semi-openly.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-170.wav|As a violent mob was breaching the doors of the Capitol, Newsmax's coverage called the scene a sort of romantic idea. Fox News, meanwhile, has spent years spewing misinformation about American politics. You notice the conflation there, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-171.wav|Fox News is exactly the same as Newsmax. It's exactly the same as O A N N.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-172.wav|And I do love that, that apparently, Newsmax, calling the scene a, quote-unquote, sort of romantic idea, which is not a good thing to say.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-173.wav|That, that apparently is the sort of offense that you'd get Newsmax taken off A T and T. However, C N N, which overtly promoted riots in the middle of the summer.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-174.wav|I mean, Chris Cuomo went on television and he said, where does it say in the constitution that protest is supposed to be peaceful? And somehow, that didn't promote, right? It's only one side of the aisle, you'll note.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-175.wav|These same networks say these Congresspeople have also been key vectors of spreading misinformation related to the pandemic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-176.wav|A media watchdog found over two hundred and fifty cases of COVID-nineteen misinformation on Fox News in just one, five-day period. Economist demonstrated Fox News had a demonstrable  impact on noncompliance with public health guidelines. They actually didn't.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-177.wav|We studied that at the time. The evidence that Fox News was directly responsible for people not wearing masks, for example, is exorbitantly weak.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-178.wav|They couldn't even link the people who are not wearing the mask to people who are watching, for example, Sean Hannity.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-179.wav|One online platform suspended demonetized O A N N's channel online because it was spreading COVID-nineteen misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-180.wav|Newsmax has amplified allegations that members of the Chinese Communist Party helped develop the COVID-nineteen vaccine.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-181.wav|That, really. That's, that's the big one that you came up with Newsmax? It's that Newsmax said that maybe the C C P has something to do with the, with the development of the virus.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-182.wav|Hey, in reality, there was a, there's a fairly good amount of information that this thing, well, not created by the C C P, was in fact leads from a Wuhan lab.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-183.wav|There's more information to that suggestion than there is the idea that it came from the wet markets as we were originally told. And some idiot ate it bad. Let's say these members of Congress, sadly, these facts are not new.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-184.wav|One popular television show aired a segment about O A N N last April that included a dire warning, the kind of misinformation O A N N is spewing right now could end up getting people killed.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-185.wav|Oh, well, you quoted last week Tonight with John Oliver. Amazing. If John Oliver says it, it must be true because John Oliver is a super reliable source.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-186.wav|Well, continue with the censorship that the Democrats are now pushing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-187.wav|This is authoritarians stuff and it can come with a happy face, but the happy face does not make it any sort of, uh, it does not mean that these people are in favor of liberty. They absolutely are not.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-188.wav|Wait, some more on this in just one second. First, if you want to save time and you want to save money, there's a great way to do it. Don't go to the post office. Like, the post office is great, but let's be real.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-200.wav|Alright. So now, we get to the crux of the matter from these Democratic Congresspeople. So they've spent most of this letter so far yelling about how they don't like Fox News and O A N N and Newsmax and how they're spewing misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-201.wav|Now, I've talked about some of the things, I think, that O A N N and Newsmax in particular were pushing about the election that were not true, that I saw no evidence for.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-202.wav|And in fact, O A N N has been forced to back off some of its allegations with regards to dominion. Same thing with Newsmax. Okay. All of that is true because there are slander and libel laws in the United States.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-203.wav|Both of them, I believe, are currently being skewed by dominion. That is the system working.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-204.wav|I'll tell you what is not the system working. Sitting members of Congress looking to have platforms. The platform, things they don't like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-205.wav|That's dangerous stuff. That's authoritarian stuff. That's top-down censorship and full authoritarian, leftist mode. So here's what these Congresspeople say. Remember, this is a letter to the head of A T and T.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-206.wav|Yet to our knowledge, the cable satellite in over-the-top companies that disseminate these media outlets to American viewers have done nothing in response to the misinformation, everybody's outlets.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-207.wav|A T and T currently carries Fox News, Newsmax, and O A N N on Uverse DirecTV and A T and T T V.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-208.wav|As a company that serves seventeen million Americans, A T and T plays a major role in the spread of dangerous misinformation that enabled the insurrection of January sixth and hinders our public health response to the current pandemic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-209.wav|And otherwise, in other words, if you don't mirror what we believe, we believe that you should shut them down. Now, notice what they're doing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-210.wav|Again, Congress cannot pass a law restricting freedom of speech, but members of Congress can pressure companies like A T and T into restricting freedom of speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-211.wav|They're essentially turning these companies into their agents in order to shut down free speech, which is authoritarians stuff. It really is. It is government working hand in glove with corporations to shut down your freedom of speech.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-212.wav|Corporations know this, by the way. Why do you think that Coca-Cola is doing diversity training? They're doing so for fear of liability.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-213.wav|They are doing so because they're afraid they're going to be sued, and that you're going to get some lefty judge who decides that discrimination has taken place,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-214.wav|because they didn't insulate themselves by buying a twenty thousand dollar Robin DiAngelo bullcrap course.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-215.wav|The reason Coca-Cola is doing this is that the Democrats leave them alone.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-216.wav|Right. The reason that all of these corporations are caving to the woke mob is because the woke mob has the weavers of power in a wide variety of institutions right now.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-217.wav|Not just at the top of corporations, where there are a lot of people who had corporations who are sympathetic to the woke mob, but they have the whip hand when it comes to the media. They have the whip hand when it comes to the social media companies.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-218.wav|And most of all, they have the whip hand when it comes to members of Congress who are willing to shut down free speech not formally through passage of a law, but through simple outside pressure.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-219.wav|So, say, these Congresspeople.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-220.wav|It is for these reasons we ask you provide us with responses to the following questions about A T and T's policies. For content carried on U-verse, DirecTV, and A T and T,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-221.wav|what moral or ethical principles do you apply in deciding which channels to carry or when to take adverse actions against the channel? They're deliberately.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-222.wav|These are not questions directed at eliciting answers, of course. These are questions elicited at, directed at listening to a response.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-223.wav|Namely, the cancellation of all of these outlets that Anna Eshoo and, uh, and Jerry McNerney don't like.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-224.wav|Two, do you require, through contracts or otherwise, that the channels you carry abide by any content guidelines? If so, please provide a copy of the guidelines.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-225.wav|How many of your subscribers tune into Fox News, Newsmax, and O A N N on Uverse DirecTV and A T and T T V.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-226.wav|For each of the four weeks proceeding the November third, twenty twenty elections, please specify the number of subscribers that tuned into each channel.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-227.wav|And, you know, that is the predicate for them setting up some sort of liability argument as though A T and T is liable for damage done at the Capitol building,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-228.wav|because there were morons who decided to commit criminal acts on the basis of speech that may or may not have been true, but certainly did not meet the standard of legal incitement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-229.wav|What steps did you take prior to on or following the November third, twenty twenty elections to monitor, respond to it, and reduce the spread of disinformation,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-230.wav|including encouragement or incitement of violence by channels your company disseminates to millions of Americans?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-231.wav|Please describe each step that you took. Have you taken any adverse actions against the channel, including Fox News for using your platform?|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-233.wav|Okay, these are members of Congress who are overtly attempting to shut down the dissemination of information because they don't like these channels.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-234.wav|Hey, all of this led to Federal Communications Commissioner, Brendan Carr, calling this effort, a chilling transgression of free speech. He wrote a letter to them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-235.wav|He said, by writing letters to cable providers and other regulated entities that carry these news media outlets, the Democrats are sending a message. That is, that is as clear as it is troubling.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-236.wav|These regulated entities will pay a price if the targeted newsrooms do not conform to Democrats' preferred political narratives. This is a chilling transgression of the free speech rights that every media outlet in this country enjoys.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-237.wav|He says, debate on matters of public interest should be robust, uninhibited, and wide open. More speech is better than less.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-238.wav|If the concerted effort by Democrats should drive political dissent from the public square represents a market departure from these First Amendment norms,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-239.wav|a newsroom is decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official, not targeted by them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-240.wav|He says to the House Democrats that use their official letterheads to launch the same query. I would say this, your demand to know the, quote-unquote, moral principles|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-241.wav|that guide a private entities decision about what news to carry cannot be reconciled with bedrock principles of free speech and journalistic freedom.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-242.wav|I call all my F C C colleagues to join me in publicly denouncing this attempt to stifle political speech and independent news judgment. But here's the thing. The Biden Administration is happy with this sort of stuff.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-243.wav|The Biden Administration has never sounded off in favor of free speech principles.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-244.wav|And. Biden. And this doesn't apply even internally to media outlets on the left. Media outlets on the left are happy to fire people who cross them.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-245.wav|And whether you're talking about the New York Times deciding to get rid of Don McNeil for the grave sin of using the N-word in a conversation about why you shouldn't use the N-word.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-246.wav|Or today, the big story is that Slate decided that they were going to get rid of a guy named Mike Pesca. Okay. Now Slate, is a very left-wing outlet.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-247.wav|Mike Pesca committed a sin, a grave sin. What did he do?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-248.wav|He used the N-word in describing why you should not use the N-word. According to defector dot com, Mike Pesca host of Slate's daily podcast, The Gist,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-249.wav|has been suspended from the company indefinitely.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-250.wav|Sources confirmed that Pesca's indefinite suspension is without pay and that his access to the company Slack and email channels had been revoked.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-251.wav|The memo announcing Pesca's suspension sent by Slate C E O, Dan Check, refers obliquely to a conversation that took place in Slack last week.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-252.wav|Defector has obtained images of the Slack conversation that Check's memo refers to, in which Pesca argues a point. He's previously gotten to hot water for arguing that in some contexts, white people should be allowed to say the N-word. Okay.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-253.wav|Again, this was in a discussion of the Don McNeil story from the New York Times.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-254.wav|So Pesca argued that McNeil's journalism made The Times more valuable to more Americans than having ousted him in twenty nineteen would have.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-255.wav|He said, my points are his internal conduct was in a gray area. You guys don't think it was. He said, expressing the views, not the word, the views he did on that trip are not fireable.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-256.wav|Worthy of talking to or what are you doing as a representative of the times, but nothing requiring much angst among management or staff.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-257.wav|Or no, should The Times discipline staffers who question the idea of white supremacy or who express retrograde ideas on mass incarceration?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-258.wav|The question is, is an outloud utterance of that word in a work environment fireable, censurable, et cetera?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-259.wav|Even as a point of clarification to a question exactly about the use of that word and this led to him essentially being fired.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-260.wav|Pesca made a final point. I don't think it's proper to use it in casual conversation, the N-word. I'm in no position to tell black New York Times workers they shouldn't be worried it's going to pop out of a colleague's mouth at some point.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-261.wav|If you want my opinion, it's that there are some limited reasons why non-African-American journalists or professor would use that word when conveying a, quote, in the name of clarity or factualness, but it's not a comfortable point to even pursue right now.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-262.wav|If I had the opposite opinion, I know a hundred ways I could make the opinion I actually have seem horrible and racist. And you know what? Maybe it is. So that's when the boss chimed in and said, maybe we should stop this conversation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-263.wav|And a Slate staffer said, quote, said this, quote, I feel outraged. I cannot believe I had to watch him enthusiastically provoke people on whether or not. It is appropriate to use a racist slur.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-264.wav|Other Slate staffers that spoke to Defector express frustration and anger at Pesca's insistence on having that particular conversation. Quote, I don't want to be in a workplace where people feel emboldened to have this argument.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-265.wav|People's humanity is not an intellectual debate.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-266.wav|Hey, Slate editor-in-chief, Jared Hohlt, then posted a message in Slack saying he didn't ever want to see a similar argument in Slack ever again, ever again.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-267.wav|He said, well, we are a workplace where people argue about things all the time. It's also a workplace where we must think very hard about the lived experience of colleagues, whose experience is different than ours.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-268.wav|Pesca has been suspended for a week and then, it has been suspended, upgraded to indefinite. This is insane. This is insane.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-269.wav|And by the way, according to Hohlt, he said that if Pesca had actually used the N-word, he didn't even use the N-word, by the way, in this conversation. So revision, he didn't even use the N-word.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-270.wav|He said there might be situations in which using the N-word is not a fireable offense because you are quoting somebody, for example.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-271.wav|Hohlt said that if Pesca had used the N-word, he definitely would have been fired. This is insane.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-272.wav|Okay. And that staffer shock apparently was not because people were upset about, about what the bosses were doing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-273.wav|It's because Pesca had actually said the N-word at work. Why? He said the N-word at work because he was quoting somebody.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-274.wav|So then, they, they've suspended him or fired him from Slate.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-275.wav|Hey, this is the authoritarian left at work and they have the upper hand in major corporations. On the left, not just on the left, in major corporations across the board.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-276.wav|So for example, Ryan Anderson, an excellent thinker over at the Heritage Foundation who writes on trans issues. It's a really, really good book. We've talked about it on the show.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-277.wav|It's called, When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Movement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-278.wav|And it is a logical point by point debunking the many of the myths surrounding transgenderism and gender identity. And the idea that gender is entirely malleable.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-279.wav|He goes through all the science.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-280.wav|Amazon pulled his book, this week.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-281.wav|The best description of that would be a digital book burning.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-282.wav|When you actually remove a book from Amazon. That is a digital book burning because the goal of a book burning is to remove that book from circulation. They just removed it. That comes on the heels of just a few months ago.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-283.wav|The attempt by Amazon to remove Abigail Shrier's book from their shelves. So now they're doing it to Ryan, Ryan Anderson's When Harry Became Sally.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-284.wav|Encounter Books, which is the publisher, they said, if Amazon, which controls most of the book sales in America, has decided to delist a book with which some of its functionaries disagree.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-285.wav|This is an unconscionable assault on free speech. It will have a chilling effect on the publishing industry and the free circulation of ideas.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-286.wav|It must not be left to stand unchallenged. That is one hundred percent right. But again, the authoritarian left is on the march.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-287.wav|The authoritarian left has cuddled corporations into doing the censorious work government cannot do.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-288.wav|They've gotten corporations to mirror their authoritarian priorities. We already know that the media mirror their authoritarian priorities, they cheer this stuff on day after day.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-289.wav|We know that social media has begun mirroring those authoritarian priorities because they're being pushed into it. By the way, it differs by corporation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-290.wav|Twitter is enthusiastic to do it. Facebook, I think, reluctantly does it. But the reality is that when you have Congress sitting on your neck and saying, they're going to break you up unless you do their bidding. Well, you end up with.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-291.wav|I mean, Dianne Feinstein literally said that. She literally said to the heads of social media, if you don't police this content, we are going to have to do something about it ourselves.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-292.wav|Okay. That is a violation of First Amendment principles, but the authoritarian left is in control.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-293.wav|So. When people say that there is an authoritarian right, and that is a grave threat to the country, there is a fringe authoritarian right.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-294.wav|I'm not gonna pretend that there aren't people on the right who believe in authoritarian principles and who don't like democracy very much or who think that democracy is so improperly functioning and we need to overthrow it or stuff like that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-295.wav|There are some people who believe that. That is a small number of people.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-296.wav|The mainstream democratic party apparently believes that it is okay to use the positions of power they have in American corporations and American institutions at universities, in the media, and in Government.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-297.wav|In order to cram down an anti-First Amendment, anti-free speech, anti-liberty position.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-298.wav|That is a mainstream left position. The authoritarian left went to war with the liberals and the authoritarian left apparently won. That is where things currently stand.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-299.wav|Alright. In just a second, we're going to be getting to Joe Biden, who, uh, apparently is a good president according to the press because he is very empathetic. That's all that matters, is that he's empathetic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-300.wav|Doesn't matter that he's pushing policy that makes no sense. He's empathetic because that's all we care about these days. We'll get to more of that in just one second.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-301.wav|First, if you are looking to make your company stronger, you need the best employees, obviously. And the best way to get great employees is to head on over to ziprecruiter.com/dailywire.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-311.wav|Alright. We're going to get to the Joe Biden commemoration for five hundred thousand lives lost.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-312.wav|First, it's that time of month when I get to sit down with some of my favorite people in the world for an episode of Backstage.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-313.wav|Yeah. You can tell I'm enthused.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-314.wav|But watch me suffer as I join Jeremy Boreing, Matt Walsh, Andrew Klavan and yes, the  execrable, and unthinkably awful Michael Knowles tomorrow night,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-315.wav|seven P M Eastern, as we round table about current events and big-picture issues like, oh, probably cancel culture.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-316.wav|So join us at daily wire dot com or on the Daily Wire YouTube to watch. Again, that is seven P M Eastern, six P M Central. Before. Going any further.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-317.wav|I want to tell you all about a new show coming out this Friday, hosted by moi.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-318.wav|I told you the beginning of the year, we had all sorts of excellent content that was coming to Daily Wire, right? You know that later on this year, we're going to have on Candace Owens.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-319.wav|Candace is going to have a new show here at Daily Wire. You already know that we're making a movie with Gina Carano. We already brought out Run Hide Fight.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-320.wav|We have all sorts of amazing content for you. Now, I am bringing out a new series and this series is going to be so useful for you.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-321.wav|It's going to be incredibly useful for you. What is it? Basically, I just debunk a leftist myth every week.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-322.wav|The left is constantly making arguments that are filled with fallacies and anti-factual assertions.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-323.wav|So every Friday in fifteen minutes or less, exclusively for our Daily Wire members, I have a new show. It's called, Debunked. Every week, I'll take a facts and logic position and put it up against a popular leftist argument.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-324.wav|The kind you see your friends post and share all over the internet, whether it's climate change or universal health care, I'm going to help you completely dismantle those particular arguments.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-327.wav|You're listening to the largest, fastest growing, conservative podcast and radio show in the nation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-328.wav|Alright. Meanwhile, Joe Biden did a commemorative event for five hundred thousand American lives lost to COVID-nineteen. Obviously that is a massive tragedy. Every one of those lives lost is indeed a tragedy.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-329.wav|And the, the goal here was really twofold. One was for him to demonstrate empathy. As you will see, this is the, the Biden line, right? This is the line all throughout the campaign.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-330.wav|It's that Donald Trump had no empathy, but Joe Biden is a man of empathy.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-331.wav|And this is what the media liked about him, is that he is capable of emoting. I mean, that, that, that is just. Right, it's his thing. And I'm not saying it's not genuine. Sure. I'll give him that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-332.wav|I'm sure that a lot of his emotion is genuine. That's fine. Emotion doesn't happen to solve problems. Very often, emotion gets in the way of solving problems.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-333.wav|And I don't judge presidents on how much empathy they have. I judge presidents on how well they do in doing the things they are supposed to do.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-334.wav|I don't care whether my plumber has empathy. I don't care whether my lawyer has empathy and I don't care whether the president has empathy.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-335.wav|I'm very, I've been clear about this since the get-go.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-336.wav|In fact, there are good studies to show that sympathy is useful in politics because it allows you to think about a wide variety of people who are not you, but empathy is actually a problem.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-337.wav|Empathy is where you put yourself in somebody else's shoes. Sympathy is where you sympathize with somebody else's positions. Empathy makes you elevate certain people above other people because you're empathizing with them, right?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-338.wav|So empathy can actually be a problem in politics. There's a great book called, Against Empathy, by, uh, by a psychologist. All about this, about how it infused, how in politics, it's, it's kind of a problem.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-339.wav|In any case, Joe Biden does this event. And in the middle of the event, he basically is.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-340.wav|The goal of the event is not only to, to demonstrate empathy, but then to suggest that people who disagree with his agenda, that the people who don't agree with the way he's approaching policy are non-empathetic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-341.wav|Right. That, that is what politics usually is, is trying to create a level of moral superiority for yourself and make your opponents seem morally inferior.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-342.wav|So Joe Biden does this event and he says, for example, it's time to end the politics in the misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-343.wav|Okay. As we've been talking about for weeks at this point, Joe Biden has been a chief purveyor of COVID misinformation since his succession to the office of president.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-344.wav|He just put out the idea that there was no COVID plan, a lie. He suggested that the COVID vaccine plan did not exist, a lie.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-345.wav|He has had people promoting the idea that teachers cannot go back to school safely right now, a lie.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-346.wav|The president of the United States has been overtly using teacher's union talking points and just shoving them into C D C standards,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-347.wav|which is disinformation and misinformation as the left likes to say.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-348.wav|Okay. But here is Joe Biden, nonetheless, saying that his opponents are the ones who are promoting politics and misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-349.wav|He's the president. He doesn't get to do this routine anymore. Now's the time for you to actually do your job.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-350.wav|Okay. That, that is such a string of platitudes. What does that mean? What does that mean? Can we get specific here? Yeah.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-351.wav|If people are saying that you should go out and you should congregate with other people, and there's no risk of COVID, if you, without vaccination or anything, and that you should not wear a mask and not socially distance. Yeah. That's gonna spread the virus.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-352.wav|Okay. So if you say that, then that would be. And you say, it's not going to spread the virus, that's misinformation. But if we are talking generally as Joe Biden says that that misinformation is the cause of the virus spreading.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-353.wav|Uh, I noticed something, which is that Andrew Cuomo, your favorite government, literally, governor, literally lied to the American people, to his own constituents, to the families of people who died.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-354.wav|He lied to his fellow democratic legislators and your administration won't even say that.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-355.wav|And then you have the temerity to get up in one of these events and say something like, we have to stop the misinformation and the politics.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-356.wav|I don't believe you. I don't believe that you were interested in that, President Biden. I wish that I believed you, but I don't.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-357.wav|But again, the goal here is just to get the media to, to cry over him, which he, uh, which he did successfully.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-358.wav|Here was a C N N's John King saying, you know, he's empathetic. That's really the thing that matters. It's the empathy, the empathy, the empathy. You know what I noticed is actually more important than the empathy? Reopening the schools and getting people to vaccines they need.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-359.wav|And also not telling people that the vaccine is not going to allow us to get back to regular life. You want to talk about putting out misinformation?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-360.wav|How about the idea that we, that we believe that you're going to transmit the virus at the same rates, whether or not you get the vaccine. And that suggestion has been put out.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-361.wav|There is absolutely evidence free. That's misinformation.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-362.wav|The vaccine does lower, not  only risk of death to something like ninety nine percent, your risk of death goes down.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-363.wav|Your risk of serious illness goes down by, like, ninety five percent, but also your risk of transmission goes down by something like ninety percent, according to the latest studies. It's misinformation to suggest otherwise.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-364.wav|Well, we don't care about that. All we care about is that Joe Biden is a caring person. He cares about you. Here's the thing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-365.wav|Let me just tell you a little secret. Joe Biden may be a caring person.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-366.wav|The government doesn't care about you because the government doesn't know your name.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-367.wav|You're a taxpayer, that's all the government cares, that's all the government cares about. You're just a, you are just a tool for them. You're a widget to the government.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-368.wav|Phil Gramm, the former Senator from Texas, he, uh, he was once told in a hearing that, by, by some witness.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-369.wav|That, that, that witness cared about his children. And Phil Gramm said, really? What are their names?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-370.wav|That is, that is exactly how you should respond. When someone from the government says, I care about you, your first response should be no, you really don't.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-371.wav|You care about me in the same way that a plumber cares about me paying him to fix my toilet. Why should we pretend that our politicians are the most caring and wonderful of people?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-372.wav|When we all know that this is precisely the opposite. But again, you have to promulgate the notion that Joe Biden is full of empathy,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-373.wav|so that you don't catch onto the fact that he's actually foolish. Here's, here's, here's John King from C N N.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-374.wav|In, in what ways you've been held accountable by you and the media? Seriously, have you seen one headline holding Joe Biden accountable for the a hundred thousand Americans who have died since he took office?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-375.wav|And they, every, every day there is a headline. Like, it's unthinkable how many Americans, it's eighty three Vietnam Wars that have happened under Donald Trump.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-376.wav|A hundred thousand Americans have died since Joe Biden took office. I haven't seen one of those headlines, not one. But, you know, he's empathetic. So that's all that matters.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-377.wav|Dana Bash did the same thing on C N N. You know, Trump was a very non-empathetic character, but we know that Joe Biden is empathetic. He's all empathy all the time.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-378.wav|Okay I'm not looking for a psychologist. I'm not looking for a priest. I'm not looking for a rabbi. I'm looking for a guy who's actually going to do what he promised and crushed the virus.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-379.wav|He's not doing any of that stuff. In fact, he's enthralled to a bunch of people whose policies are completely non-empathetic because they don't actually care about Americans.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-380.wav|Let me give you an example. Ro Khanna is a Democratic Congressperson and he says he was asked about minimum wage, right? The minimum wage is in the Joe Biden COVID relief bill.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-381.wav|Here's his response about minimum wage killing small businesses. Does this sound empathetic to you? So when it comes to the policy, this crap ain't sympathetic. Here is Ro Khanna.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-382.wav|He knows how your business runs better than you do. And if you don't agree with him, he's perfectly happy for your business to go under.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-383.wav|That's all that matters to him. Right. Town's empathetic to you, doesn't it? Super empathy, empathy. He's empathetic. He's empathetic. Also, if your business goes under it, he doesn't care.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-384.wav|Also if your kid can't go back to school, he doesn't care. You want to know what the actual underlying emotiveism here is about.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-385.wav|It is all about garnering sympathy for political positions that are completely non-empathetic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-386.wav|We all know this. The Biden Administration is mirroring all of the priorities of the American Federation of Teachers when it comes to reopening schools.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-387.wav|Here by the way is what the American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, had to say about whether kids are going to recover from missing an entire year of school,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-388.wav|not being with their classmates, experiencing significant mental health disorders.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-389.wav|Really. I know many people who have had kids who are suffering with this sort of stuff. Here is that the very empathetic Randi Weingarten on this topic.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-390.wav|Okay so, what she just said is F the kids. Okay, let me translate that very quickly. She said, F the kids, that's what that meant.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-391.wav|Okay so, for all of the empathy and the motiveism, and what it really comes down to when it comes down to policy it's which constituency can I please today?|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-392.wav|Recognize this is true for all of your politicians, Democrat, Republican, all of them. Anybody who looks for. You, you want sympathy? Get a dog.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-393.wav|You want, you want empathy? Get married.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-394.wav|You want to, you want your politicians to bring you these things, you're looking for love in all the wrong places. And you deserve to have whatever ridiculous policy they promote shoved down your face.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-395.wav|Because if that's where, if that's what you're looking for your love, my goodness. Get a life, get a community, get friends. All right.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-396.wav|We'll be back here later today with an additional hour of content. Otherwise, coming up soon is the Matt Walsh show that airs at one thirty P M Eastern.|0
